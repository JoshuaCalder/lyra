###Let It Be###The Beatles
[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
“Let it be”
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
“Let it be”

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
And when the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on till tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
###Come Together###The Beatles
[Intro: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly

Shoot me, shoot me

[Guitar Solo]

Come, come, come, come

He say, "One and one and one is three."
Got to be good-lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Ugh!

Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Uh...

###Hey Jude###The Beatles
[Verse 1]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Verse 2]
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin

###Yesterday###The Beatles
[Verse 1]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
###Something###The Beatles
[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
###Blackbird###The Beatles
[Verse 1]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Verse 2]
Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

[Verse 3]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
###A Day in the Life###The Beatles
[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

[alarm clock rings]

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Outro]
###Here Comes the Sun###The Beatles
[Intro]
Here comes the sun, doo doo doo doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 2]
Little darling, the smiles are returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Bridge]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

[Verse 3]
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Outro]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right
###I Am the Walrus###The Beatles
[Verse 1]
I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

[Verse 2]
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Verse 3]
Mister City, policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

[Verse 4]
Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Verse 5]
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

[Chorus]
I am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made to tame fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob (good pity)
G-goo goo g'joob

[Verse 6]
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

[Verse 7]
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g-goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob, goo goo

[Outro]
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one
Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
“Villain, take my Purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party. Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire.”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you.”
###In My Life###The Beatles
[Verse 1]
There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

[Verse 2]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

[Outro]
In my life I love you more
###Across the Universe###The Beatles
[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Outro: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
###Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds###The Beatles
[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
###Eleanor Rigby###The Beatles
[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

[Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Refrain]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Chorus]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?
###Strawberry Fields Forever###The Beatles
[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "no" will mean a "yes", but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Outro]
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

Cranberry sauce
###Michelle###The Beatles

Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle

[Chorus]
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble

Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble

[Outro]
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle
###With a Little Help from My Friends###The Beatles
[Segue: The Beatles]
Billy Shears!

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

Are you sad because you're on your own?

No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends

###While My Guitar Gently Weeps###The Beatles
[Chorus 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 1]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Chorus 2]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Chorus 3]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh
###Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)###The Beatles
[Verse 1]
I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"

[Chorus 1]
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

[Verse 2]
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"

[Chorus 2]
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

[Verse 3]
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?
###Don't Let Me Down###The Beatles
[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oh, she does
Yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me
Yes, she does

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney & George Harrison]
I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past (Seeking past)

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Outro: John Lennon]

Can you dig it? Don't let me down
###Help!###The Beatles
[Intro: John Lennon]
(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me? Help me? Ooh
###Paint It Black###The Rolling Stones
[Chorus]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Verse]
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day
I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

[Chorus]
I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

[Outro]
I wanna see it painted, painted black
Black as night, black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black
Yeah
###Sympathy for the Devil###The Rolling Stones
[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 3]
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

Oh yeah, get down heavy!
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Variation]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game

[Verse 4]
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Instrumental outro with scatting and ad-lib vocals]

###Wild Horses###The Rolling Stones
[Verse 1]
Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

[Chorus]
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away

[Verse 2]
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Can make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

[Chorus]
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, couldn't drag me away

[Verse 3]
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken tears must be cried
Let's do some living after we die

[Chorus]
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them some day
###You Can't Always Get What You Want###The Rolling Stones
[Intro: London Bach Choir]
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she would meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man
No, you can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometime
You'll find
You get what you need

[Verse 1]
I saw her today at the reception
A glass of wine in her hand
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
At her feet was a footloose man

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you  might find
You get what you need

[Verse 2]
And I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration
If we don't, we're going to blow a 50-amp fuse"

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need

[Verse 3]
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead"
I said to him:

[Chorus]
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes
Well, you just might find
You get what you need

[Verse 4]
You get what you need, yeah, oh baby
I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands

[Outro]
You can't always get what you want, yeah
You can't always get what you want, ooh yeah
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you just might find
You just might find you get what you need, ah yeah
Ah yeah
Wooh!
Ah you can't always get what you want (no no)
You can't always get what you want (you can't no no)
You can't always get what you want
...mmm but if you try sometimes, you just might find
You just might find you get what you need
Ah yeah!
Ah yeah! Yeah

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

[Verse 1]
When I'm driving in my car

The same cigarettes as me

Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say

When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week

I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I say!

###Honky Tonk Women###The Rolling Stones

I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me with roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

[Chorus]
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

[Verse 3]
Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
Naked as the day that I will die
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris
But I just don't seem to sail you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

###Angie###The Rolling Stones
[Verse]
Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
Angie, you're beautiful
But ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, I still love you
Remember all those nights we cried?
All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
Oh, Angie, don't you weep
All your kisses still taste sweet
I hate that sadness in your eyes
Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye?
Angie, Angie
Ain't it time we said goodbye?
With no loving in our souls
And no money in our coats
You can't say were satisfied
But Angie, I still love you, Baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on Baby, dry your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?
Angie, Angie
They can't say we never tried
###Jumpin' Jack Flash###The Rolling Stones
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
One two!
I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at the maw in the drivin' rain
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Verse 2]
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Verse 3]
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
Yeah, yeah
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread.
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
My, my, yeah
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

Don't make a grown man cry
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy
She's a mean, mean machine

Start it up

You got to never, never, never stop
Slide it up, baby just slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up, never, never, never

If you start it up
Love the day when we will never stop, never stop
Never, never, never stop
Tough me up
Never stop, never stop

It's down to me
The difference in the clothes she wears

Under my thumb a girl who has just changed her ways

Under my thumb, well I, I can still look at someone else

Talking to some rich folk that you know
Well, I hope you won't see me in my ragged company
Well, you know I could never be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Take me down little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground

[Verse 1]
She would never say where she came from
Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
While the sun is bright
Or in the darkest night
No one knows
She comes and goes

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

[Verse 2]
Don't question why she needs to be so free
She'll tell you it's the only way to be
She just can't be chained
To a life where nothing's gained
And nothing's lost
At such a cost

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

[Verse 3]
"There's no time to lose," I heard her say
"Catch your dreams before they slip away
Dying all the time
Lose your dreams and you
Will lose your mind
Ain't life unkind?"

[Chorus]
Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you

Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
Who could hang a name on you?
When you change with every new day
Still I'm going to miss you
###Tumbling Dice###The Rolling Stones
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown
Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
But baby, I go crazy, there's fever in the funk house now
This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a itchin'
You know you know the deuce is still wild

[Chorus]
Baby, I can't stay, you got to roll me
And call me the tumbling dice

[Verse 2]
Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines
Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime

[Chorus]
But baby, get it straight
You got to roll me and call me the tumbling
Roll me and call me the tumbling dice

[Bridge]
Oh, my, my, my, I'm the lone craps shooter
Playing the field every night

She said, "My breasts, they will always be open
Baby, you can rest your weary head right on me
And there will always be a space in my parking lot
When you need a little coke and sympathy"

[Chorus]
Yeah, we all need someone we can dream on
And if you want it, baby, well you can dream on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can cream on
And if you want to, well you can cream on me

I was dreaming of a steel guitar engagement
When you drunk my health in scented jasmine tea
But you knifed me in my dirty, filthy basement
With that jaded, faded, junky nurse - oh what pleasant company

Come on, we all need someone we can feed on
Yeah, and if you want it, well you can feed on me
Hey, take my arm, take my leg
Oh baby, don't you take my head

[Chorus]
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, well you can bleed on me
Yeah, we all need someone we can bleed on
Yeah, and if you want it, baby, why don't you bleed on me (All over)

[Verse 3]
Ah, get it on rider, get it on rider, get it on rider
You can bleed all over me, yeah
Get it on rider, get it on rider, yeah
You can be my rider, you can come all over me, oh
Get it on rider, get it on rider, get it on rider
You can come all over me
###Mother's Little Helper###The Rolling Stones
[Intro]
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 1]
Things are different today", I hear every mother say
Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill, there's a little yellow pill

[Refrain]
She goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way, gets her through her busy day

[Verse 2]
"Things are different today", I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for a husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake and she burns a frozen steak

[Refrain]
And goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And to help her on her way, get her through her busy day

[Chorus]
Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 3]
"Men just aren't the same today", I hear every mother say
"They just don't appreciate that you get tired"
"They're so hard to satisfy", you can tranquilize your mind

[Refrain]
So go running for the shelter of your mother's little helper
And four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight

[Chorus]
Doctor, please, some more of these
Outside the door, she took four more
What a drag it is getting old

[Verse 4]
"Life's just much too hard today", I hear ev'ry mother say
The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those, you will get an overdose

[Refrain]
No more running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
They just helped you on your way through your busy dying day

Hey
###Stairway to Heaven###Led Zeppelin
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying the stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, it makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
And it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

[Outro]
And she's buying the stairway to heaven
###Immigrant Song###Led Zeppelin
[Intro]​
(2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 1]
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde
Sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Chorus]
Ahh! Ahh!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

[Verse 2]
How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

[Refrain]
On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

[Verse 3]
So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing
###Kashmir###Led Zeppelin
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

[Verse 2]
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying

[Verse 4]
All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

[Verse 5]
Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

[Verse 6]
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Bridge]

[Verse 7/Outro]
When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, oh, my baby, let me take you there
Come on, let me take you there...let me take you there
###Whole Lotta Love###Led Zeppelin

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You've been cooling, baby, I've been drooling

Going to give you my love

[Chorus]
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

[Outro]
Way down inside, woman, you need love

Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
###Black Dog###Led Zeppelin
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, I can't keep away

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I got to roll, can't stand still
Got a flaming heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine, burning red
Dreams of you all through my head
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Bridge]
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Tell me would you do me now
Hey baby, oh baby, pretty baby
Move me while you groove me now

[Verse 3]
Take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started tellin' her friend she' gon' be a star
I don't know, but I've been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 4]
All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rollin' woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ahh

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Hey baby,  pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby,  pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby,  pretty baby, oh baby
###Going to California###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank, all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching, in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers, in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same

[Verse 2]
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake

[Verse 3]
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

[Verse 4]
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings...
La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems...
###Thank You###Led Zeppelin
[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

[Bridge]
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

[Verse 1]
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration - look, see

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Alright, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness - I'm glad

[Chorus]
If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me
###Ramble On###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
Leaves are falling all around, It's time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm going around the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "Our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on
And now the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm going around the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on
I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Bridge]
I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one
Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
Ramblin'
I'm gonna
Shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way going round the world
Baby baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby
I think "we gots to part"
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby baby baby baby baby
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I
I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby
###Babe I'm Gonna Leave You###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a-rolling
Leave you when the summer comes along

[Verse 2]
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby, baby
I want to leave you
I ain't joking woman, I've got to ramble
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I believin'
We really got to ramble (I can hear it calling me)
I can hear it calling me the way it used to do
I can hear it calling me back home

[Bridge 1]
Babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know, I've really got to leave you
Oh I can hear it calling me
I said don't you hear it calling me the way it used to do?

[Verse 3]
I know I know, I know
I never, never, never, never, never gonna leave you, babe
But I got to go away from this place
I've got to quit you, yeah
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh, don't you hear it callin' me?
Oh, woman, woman, I know, I know
It feels good to have you back again
And I know that one day baby, it's gonna really grow, yes it is
We gonna go walkin' through the park every day
Come what may, every day, oh
My my my my my, my babe
I'm gonna leave you, go away

[Bridge 2]
Oh I miss you, baby
It was really, really good
You made me happy every single day
But now I've got to go away
Oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
That's when it's calling me
I said that's when it's calling me back home
###Dazed and Confused###Led Zeppelin
[Chorus]
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

[Verse 1]
You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run around sweet baby, Lord how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you baby, here I come again

[Extra Verse]
If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

[Verse 2]
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy baby, let them say what they will
Did your tongue wag so much when I sent you the bill?
###All My Love###Led Zeppelin
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

[Verse 2]
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

[Chorus]
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now

[Verse 3]
The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

[Chorus]
Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you, child

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

[Outro]
Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, oh yes
All of my love to you
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love!
Sometimes, sometimes
Hey hey hey hey, ooooh yeah
It's all all all
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
I get a little bit lonely
Just a little, just a little
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely
###When the Levee Breaks###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
If it keeps on raining
Levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining
The levee's going to break
When the levee breaks
We'll have no place to stay

[Verse 2]
Mean old levee
Taught me to weep and moan, oh
Mean old levee
Taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes
To make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well, oh well, oh well, ooh

[Bridge]
Oh don't it make you feel bad
When you're trying to find your way home
You don't know which way to go
If you're going down south
They got no work to do
If you're going north to Chicago

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Crying won't help you
Praying won't do you no good
No, crying won't help you
Praying won't do you no good
When the levee breaks
Mama, you got to move, ooh

[Verse 4]
All last night
I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night
Sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby
And my happy home
Oh-ho

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Going
I'm going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry, but I can't take you
Going down
Going down now
Going down
I'm going down now
Going down
Going down
Going down
Going down
Ohh
Going down
Going down now
Going down
Going down now
Going down
Going down now
Going down
Going, dow- dow- dow- dow- down now
Ooh, ooh
###No Quarter###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
The pain, the pain without quarter
They ask no quarter
The dogs of doom are howling more!
###The Rain Song###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oooh, oh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, oooh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, ohhhh, oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uhh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah
###Since I've Been Loving You###Led Zeppelin
[Pre-Chorus]
Been working from seven to eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right

[Verse 1]
I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
Cause I love you baby
How I love you darling
How I love you, baby
My beloved little girl, little girl

[Chorus]
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you I really did the best I could

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been, I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag
Lord, yeah, that ain't right

[Chorus]
Since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

[Verse 3]
Do you remember mama
When I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them
Newfangled, newfangled back-door men

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been working from
Seven, seven, seven, to eleven, eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, drag
Yeah, it makes it a drag

[Chorus]
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose my worried mind
Oh yeah
Just one more, just one more, oooh, yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind
###The Battle of Evermore###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all, oh

[Chorus]
I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

[Verse 2]
The apples of the valley hold
The seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

[Verse 3]
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow (Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back

[Outro]
At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
Oh now, oh now, oh now
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
Oh now, oh now, oh now
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
###Over the Hills and Far Away###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling; walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much, so much, so much

[Verse 2]
Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ooh!
Really ought to know, oh, oh, oh
I really ought to know
You know I should know, I should know, I should have known
###Heartbreaker###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

[Verse 3]
People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 4]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

[Outro]
Heartbreaker; your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart!
###Rock and Roll###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Yes it has

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

[Verse 3]
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in

[Chorus]
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
###Good Times Bad Times###Led Zeppelin
[Verse 1]
In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

[Verse 2]
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
Only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oooh

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

[Verse 3]
I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbours say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part
###Bohemian Rhapsody###Queen
[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightning me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

[Outro]
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
###Love of My Life###Queen
[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me

You've stolen my love, and now desert me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]

To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)

[Chorus]
Back, hurry back, please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Outro]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh

I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me
'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you (Yeah, yeah)

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time

###Killer Queen###Queen
[Verse 1]
She keeps a Moët et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Anytime)
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Drop of a hat she's as willing as playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action, temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

[Outro]
Wanna try?
###Another One Bites the Dust###Queen
[Intro]
Ooh, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

[Verse 2]
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh

[Verse 3]
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust


[Outro]
Shoot out
Ay-yeah
Alright
###We Will Rock You###Queen

Kicking your can all over the place, singing

###Radio Ga Ga###Queen
[Intro]
Radio...
Radio...

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made them laugh, you made them cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you!

[Bridge]
(Radio ga ga  Radio ga ga)

[Outro]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

###We Are The Champions###Queen
[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions...
###The Show Must Go On###Queen
[Verse 1]
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Verse 2]
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

[Bridge]
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

[Chorus]
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

[Verse 3]
I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on
###Somebody to Love###Queen

Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet

I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

Think of you always
I miss you (I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
Love you, Love you
Hey boy where do you get it from?
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion in the good old fashioned
School of lover boys

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 o'clock) precisely
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours, that will be fine (Come on and get it)

[Chorus]
"Ooh love (there he goes again)
Ooh lover boy (who's my good old-fashioned lover boy? ooh ooh)
What're you doing tonight, hey boy"
Everything's all right, just hold on tight
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned (fashioned) lover boy
###I Want It All###Queen
[Intro: Queen]
I want it all (Hey, yeah), I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
Adventure seeker on an empty street
Just an alley creeper light on his feet
A young fighter screaming with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger, can't see a way out

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
"It ain't much I'm asking," I heard him say
"Got to find me a future, move out of my way"

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
Listen, all you people, come gather 'round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine
People, do you hear me? Just give me the sign

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all (Give it all, I want it all)
I want it all, and I want it now (Hey)
I want it all, I want it all (Yes, I want it all, hey)
I want it all, and I want it now

[Bridge: Brian May (and Freddie Mercury)]
I'm a man with a one-track mind
So much to do in one lifetime (People, do you hear me?)
Not a man for compromise
And 'wheres' and 'whys' and living lies
So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all)
And I'm giving it all (And I'm giving it all, ooh, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Freddie Mercury]
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth
(Hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)

[Chorus: Queen]
I want it all, I want it all
I want it all, and I want it now
I want it all, I want it all (Hey, yeah, yeah)
I want it all, and I want it now (Ooh, ooh)
I want it now

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]
I want it, I want it!
Oooh, huh!
###'39###Queen
[Verse 1]
In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day and the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Verse 2]
In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey, little darlin', wellaway
But my love, this cannot be
For so many years are gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Outro]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
For my life, still ahead, pity me
###Wish You Were Here###Pink Floyd
[Intro]
— And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes
Now which is it?
I am sure of it

[Verse 1]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Do you think you can tell?

[Verse 2]
Did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

[Chorus]
How I wish
How I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here
###Time###Pink Floyd
[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away
The moments that make up the dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around
On a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then, one day, you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour, Richard Wright & Clare Torry]
And you run, and you run
To catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same
In a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught (Oh-oh)
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

["Breathe" reprise: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells
###Comfortably Numb###Pink Floyd
[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Hello? (Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on, now (Come on, come on)
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2: Waters]
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick [Ding]
There'll be no more "AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Chorus 2: Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo]
###Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2###Pink Floyd
[Verse: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher leave the kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse: Kid Chorus]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave the kids alone
Hey! Teacher! Leave us kids alone!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Wrong! Do it again! *Children playing*
Wrong! Do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! (Wrong! Do it again!)
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat? (Wrong! Do it again!)
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!
(If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding! How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?)
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still, laddie!
*Children playing* *Phone beep sound*
###Money###Pink Floyd
[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

[Solos]

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise
It's no surprise that they're giving none away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away

[Outro: Interview excerpts]
- Yeah -- (chuckles) -- I was in the right!
- Yes, absolutely in the right!
- I certainly was in the right!
- Yeah, I was definitely in the right
That geezer was cruising for a bruising...
- Yeah
- Why does anyone do anything?
- I don't know, I was really drunk at the time...
- I was just telling him it was in, he could get it in Number Two
He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven
After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven
It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out
###Brain Damage###Pink Floyd
[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
The lunatic is on the grass
The lunatic is on the grass
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
Got to keep the loonies on the path
The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paperboy brings more

[Chorus 1]
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
And if there is no room upon the hill
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Verse 2]
The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You rearrange me 'til I'm sane
You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me

[Chorus 2]
And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
You shout and no one seems to hear
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

[Outro - Peter Watts and Patricia Watts]
I can't think of anything to say except
Hahahahahahaha!
I think it's marvellous!
Hahaha...
###Breathe (In The Air)###Pink Floyd
[Verse 1]
Breathe, breathe in the air
Don't be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground
For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

[Verse 2]
Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it's time to dig another one
For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave
###Us and Them###Pink Floyd
[Verse 1: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)]
Us and them
And after all we're only ordinary men
Me and you
God only knows it's not what we would choose to do
"Forward" he cried from the rear and the front rank died
And the general sat
And the lines on the map moved from side to side

[Verse 2: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)]
Black and blue
And who knows which is which and who is who
Up and down
And in the end it's only round and round
"Haven't you heard it's a battle of words?"
The poster bearer cried
"Listen son", said the man with the gun
"There's room for you inside"

[Interlude]
I mean, they're not gonna kill ya
So if you give 'em a quick short, sharp, shock, they won't do it again
Dig it? I mean he get off lightly
Cause I would've given him a thrashing
I only hit him once!
It was only a difference of opinion
But really, I mean good manners don't cost nothing do they, eh?

[Verse 3: David Gilmour (backed by Richard Wright)]
Down and out
It can't be helped but there's a lot of it about
With, without
And who'll deny it's what the fighting's all about?
Out of the way, it's a busy day
I've got things on my mind
For the want of the price of tea and a slice
The old man died
###Hey You###Pink Floyd
[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey you, out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you, standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you, don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Bass Break]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
We fall, we fall, we fall, we fall
We fall, we fall, we fall, we fall
###Echoes###Pink Floyd
[Verse 1]
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

[Chorus 1]
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
Starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

[Chorus 2]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

[4:56 - 19:11 - Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

[Chorus 3]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky
###Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Pts. 1-5###Pink Floyd
[Part 1 Instrumental]

[Part 2 Instrumental]

[Part 3 Instrumental]

[Part 4]

[Verse 1]
Remember when you were young (Ha, ha, ha)
You shone like the Sun
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on, you crazy diamond
You were caught in the crossfire
Of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger
You legend, you martyr, and shine

[Verse 2]
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on, you crazy diamond
Well, you wore out your welcome
With random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver
You seer of visions
Come on, you painter
You piper, you prisoner, and shine

[Part 5 - Instrumental]
###Mother###Pink Floyd
[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh-ah, mother, should I build the wall?
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh-ah, is it just a waste of time?

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Hush now, baby; baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm
Oooh, babe; oooh, babe; oh, babe
Of course, Mamma's gonna help build the wall

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: Waters]
Mother, do you think she's good enough–for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous–to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh-ah, mother, will she break my heart?

[Chorus: Gilmour]
Hush now, baby; baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in
Mamma will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
Oooh, babe; oooh, babe; oh, babe
You'll always be baby to me

[Outro: Waters]
Mother, did it need to be so high?
###Eclipse###Pink Floyd
[Verse: Roger Waters]
All that you touch
And all that you see
All that you taste
All you feel

And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save

And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy
Beg, borrow, or steal

And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say

And all that you eat
And everyone you meet
And all that you slight
And everyone you fight

And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come
And everything under

The sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed
By the moon

[Outro]
(There is no dark side in the moon really
Matter of fact it's all dark)
###Dogs###Pink Floyd
[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

[Verse 3: David Gilmour]
And when you lose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

[Interlude]
(stone, stone, stone...)

[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable, and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer

[Verse 5: Roger Waters]
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on the back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Who was dragged down by the stone
###The Great Gig in the Sky###Pink Floyd
[Intro]
I am not frightened of dying
Any time will do, I don't mind
Why should I be frightened of dying?
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I never said I was frightened of dying
###Pigs (Three Different Ones)###Pink Floyd
[Verse 1]
Big man, pig man
Ha ha charade you are
You well heeled big wheel
Ha ha charade you are
And when your hand is on your heart
You’re nearly a good laugh
Almost a joker
With your head down in the pig bin
Saying “Keep on digging”
Pig stain on your fat chin
What do you hope to find
Down in the pig mine?

[Refrain]
You’re nearly a laugh
You’re nearly a laugh
But you’re really a cry

[Verse 2]
Bus stop rat bag
Ha ha charade you are
You fucked up old hag
Ha ha charade you are
You radiate cold shafts of broken glass
You’re nearly a good laugh
Almost worth a quick grin
You like the feel of steel
You’re hot stuff with a hatpin
And good fun with a hand gun

[Refrain]
You’re nearly a laugh
You’re nearly a laugh
But you’re really a cry

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Hey you, Whitehouse
Ha ha charade you are
You house proud town mouse
Ha ha charade you are
You’re trying to keep our feelings off the street
You’re nearly a real treat
All tight lips and cold feet
And do you feel abused?
You gotta stem the evil tide
And keep it all on the inside

[Refrain]
Mary you’re nearly a treat
Mary you’re nearly a treat
But you’re really a cry
###Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 1###Pink Floyd
[Verse]
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what d'ya leave behind for me?
All in all, it was just a brick in the wall
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall
###In the Flesh (Part II)###Pink Floyd
[Verse 1]
So ya thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel that warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand

[Verse 2]
Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
That one looks Jewish!
And that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint!
And another with spots!
If I had my way
I'd have all of you shot!
###High Hopes###Pink Floyd
[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
"Is that Charlie? Hello Charlie!
Great..."
###In the Flesh?###Pink Floyd
[Prelude]
...we came in?

[Verse]
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
Tell me is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through the disguise

[Outro]
Lights!
Roll the sound effects!
Action!
Drop it, drop it on 'em, drop it on them!

[Fade to baby crying]
###Back in Black###AC/DC
[Verse 1]
Back in black, I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hanging about
I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

[Verse 2]
Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black

[Chorus]
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, yes I'm back
Well, I'm back, back
Well, I'm back in black
Yes, I'm back in black, yow

[Bridge]
Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Take my love
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Ah, hey yeah
Ooh, yeah

Well, I'm back (I'm back)
Back, well I'm (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back (I'm back)
Back
Back in black
Yes, I'm back in black
I've hit the sack
###Thunderstruck###AC/DC
[Intro]
Thunder, ah

I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round
And I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew
There was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns
Tore me apart

[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck

[Verse 2]
Went down the highway
Broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas
Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls
Some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck

###You Shook Me All Night Long###AC/DC
[Verse 1]
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

[Verse 2]
Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long

Come right in, forget about him
We'll have ourselves a ball

Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure
They're the balls that I like best
My balls are always bouncing
To the left and to the right
It's my belief that my big balls
Should be held every night

[Chorus 2]
We've got big balls

She gave me the Queen
She gave me the King
She was wheelin' and dealin'
Just doin' her thing
She was holdin' a pair
But I had to try
Her Deuce was wild
But my Ace was high

[Pre-Chorus]
But how was I to know
That she'd been dealt with before?
Said she'd never had a Full House
But I should have known
From the tattoo on her left leg
And the garter on her right
She'd have the card to bring me down
If she played it right

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack

Poker face was her name
Poker face was her nature
Poker straight was her game
If she knew she could get you
She played 'em fast
And she played 'em hard
She could close her eyes
And feel every card

[Pre-Chorus]
But how was I to know
That she'd been shuffled before?
Said she'd never had a Royal Flush
But I should have known
That all the cards were coming
From the bottom of the pack
And if I'd known what she was dealing out
I'd have dealt it back

She's got the jack, she's got the jack
She's got the jack, she's got the jack

###Ride On###AC/DC
[Verse 1]
It's another lonely evening
In another lonely town
But I ain’t too young to worry
And I ain’t too old to cry
When a woman gets me down
Got another empty bottle
And another empty bed
Ain’t too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm going to do...

[Chorus]
I'm gonna ride on

(Ride on) Thumb in the air
(Ride on) One of these days I'm gonna change my evil ways
Till then I'll just keep riding on

[Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
Broke another promise
And I broke another heart
But I ain’t too young to realize
That I ain’t too old to try
Try to get back to the start
And it's another red-light nightmare
Woah, another red-light street
And I ain’t too old to hurry
Cause I ain’t too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm lonely
Lord I'm lonely
What am I gonna do?

[Chorus]
I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
(Ride on) Got myself a one-way ticket
(Ride on) Goin' the wrong way
(Ride on) Gonna change my evil ways
... one of these days
One of these days...

[Solo 2]

[Chorus]
I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
Ride on

To me, it makes good, good sense
Good sense, just go

###Blackstar ★###David Bowie
[Intro]
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
In the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
Your eyes
On the day of execution, on the day of execution
Only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
​
[Bridge I]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
In the villa of Ormen, in the villa of Ormen
Stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
Your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

[​Bridge II]
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
How many times does an angel fall?
How many people lie instead of talking tall?
He trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar)
​
I can't answer why (I'm a blackstar)
Just go with me (I'm not a filmstar)
I'ma take you home (I'm a blackstar)
Take your passport and shoes (I'm not a popstar)
And your sedatives, boo (I'm a blackstar)
You're a flash in the pan (I'm not a marvel star)
I'm the Great I Am (I'm a blackstar)
​
I'm a blackstar, way up, on money, I've got game
I see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
I want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar)
Something happened on the day he died
Spirit rose a metre then stepped aside
Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(I'm a blackstar, I'm a star's star, I'm a blackstar)
I can't answer why (I'm not a gangstar)
But I can tell you how (I'm not a flam star)
We were born upside-down (I'm a star's star)
Born the wrong way 'round (I’m not a white star)
I'm a blackstar, I'm not a gangstar
I'm a blackstar, I'm a blackstar
I'm not a pornstar, I'm not a wandering star
I'm a blackstar, I’m a blackstar

[Bridge III]​
In the villa of Ormen stands a solitary candle
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes
On the day of execution, only women kneel and smile
Ah-ah, ah-ah
At the centre of it all, your eyes, your eyes
Ah-ah-ah

[Outro]
###Space Oddity###David Bowie
[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills
And put your helmet on
(10) Ground Control (9) to Major Tom (8)
(7, 6) Commencing (5) countdown
Engines on (4, 3, 2)
Check ignition (1)
And may God's love (Liftoff) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

[Chorus]
-Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental outro]
###Lazarus###David Bowie
[​​​Intro]

[Verse 1]
Look up here, I'm in heaven
I've got scars that can't be seen
I've got drama, can't be stolen
Everybody knows me now

[Verse 2]
Look up here, man, I'm in danger
I've got nothing left to lose
I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

[Bridge]
By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

[Verse 3]
This way or no way
You know I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now, ain't that just like me?

Oh, I'll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh, I'll be free
Ain't that just like me?

[Outro]
###"Heroes"###David Bowie
[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh we can be heroes, just for one day

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing, will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns, shot above our heads (over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh, just for one day
###Life on Mars?###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, "No!"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

[Verse 2]
It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
Because Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

[Chorus]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
###Changes###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
I still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

[Verse 2]
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

[Bridge]
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace I'm going through

[Chorus]
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
(Turn and face the strange)
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time
###Girl Loves Me###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
Cheena so sound, so titi up this malchick, say
Party up moodge, nanti vellocet round on Tuesday
Real bad dizzy snatch making all the omies mad - Thursday
Popo blind to the polly in the hole by Friday

[Bridge]
Where the fuck did Monday go?

Who the fuck's gonna mess with me?

[Chorus]
Girl loves me

[Verse 2]

Viddy viddy at the cheena

[Chorus]
Girl loves me
(Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me
(Hey, cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me

[Refrain]
Where the fuck did Monday go?
Where the fuck did Monday go?
###Starman###David Bowie
[Intro]
Hey now, now
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Didn't know what time it was the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin down some rock n roll lotta soul, he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

[Verse 2]
I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[Chorus]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie
###I Can't Give Everything Away###David Bowie
[Produced By David Bowie & Tony Visconti]

[Verse 1]
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

[Verse 2]
Seeing more and feeling less
Saying no but meaning yes
This is all I ever meant
That's the message that I sent

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away

[Verse 1]
I know something's very wrong
The pulse returns the prodigal sons
The blackout hearts, the flowered news
With skull designs upon my shoes

[Chorus]
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
I can't give everything
Away
I can't give everything
Away
###'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore###David Bowie
​[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
‘Tis my curse, I suppose
That was patrol
That was patrol
This is the war

[​Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Black struck the kiss, she kept my cock
Smote the mistress, drifting on
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
She stole my purse, with rattling speed
That was patrol
This is the war
‘Tis a pity she was a whore

[Bridge 2]​​

[Verse 3]
Man, she punched me like a dude
Hold your mad hands, I cried
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
‘Tis my fate, I suppose
For, that was patrol
That was patrol
‘Tis a pity she was a whore

[Outro]
‘Tis a pity she was a whore
Woo!
Ahh! Woo!
Woo!
###The Man Who Sold the World###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone
A long long time ago"

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
###Modern Love###David Bowie
[Intro]

I know when to go out
And when to stay in
Get things done
I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye
But I try
I try
There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion
(God and Man)
Don't believe
In Modern Love

[Bridge]
It's not really work
It's just the power to charm
I'm still standing in the wind
But I never wave bye bye

But I try
I try

[Chorus]
Never going to fall for
(Modern Love)
Walks beside me
(Modern Love)
Walks on by
(Modern Love)
Gets me to the Church on Time
(Church on Time)
Terrifies me
(Church on Time)
Makes me party
(Church on Time)
Puts my trust in God and Man
(God and Man)
No confessions!
(God and Man)
No religion
(God and Man)
Don't believe
In Modern Love

[Outro]
Modern love - Modern love - Modern love - Modern love
Modern love - Modern love - Modern love - Modern love
- Modern love - Modern love - Modern love - Modern love
Modern love -  Walks beside me, Modern love
Modern love -  Walks on by, Modern love
Modern love -  Walks beside me, Modern love
Modern love -  Walks on by, Modern love
###Ziggy Stardust###David Bowie
[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
Oh he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded man,
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Oooh
Oh hohoo

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar
###Dollar Days###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
Cash girls suffer me, I’ve got no enemies
I’m walking down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see

[Chorus 1]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
We bitches tear our magazines
Those Oligarchs with foaming mouths phone
Now and then
Can’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Verse 2]
Dollar days, survival sex
Honour stretching tails to necks
I’m falling down
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I’m running to
It’s nothing to me
It’s nothing to see

[Chorus 2]
I’m dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I’m trying to
It’s all gone wrong but on and on
The bitter nerve ends never end
I’m falling down
Don’t believe for just one second I’m forgetting you
I’m trying to
I’m dying to

[Outro]
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
I’m trying to
I’m dying to
###Moonage Daydream###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

[Verse 2]
Don't fake it baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh-
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

[Outro]
Freak out, far out, in out
###Ashes to Ashes###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed to love
Sordid details following"
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
And I ain't got no money and ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junky
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Verse 2]
Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are rolling me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol
I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue
I want an axe to break the ice
I wanna come down right now

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

[Outro]
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
###Five Years###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse
It had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store
Everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

[Verse 2]
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful
I want you to walk

[Outro]
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years
###Sue (or In a Season of Crime)###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
Sue
I got the job
We'll buy the house
You'll need to rest
But now we'll make it

[Verse 2]
Sue
The clinic called
The x-ray's fine
I brought you home
I just said home

[Verse 3]
Sue, you said you want it writ
Sue, the virgin on your stone
For your grave
Why too dark to speak the words?
For, I know that you have a son
Oh, folly, Sue

[Verse 4]
Ride the train, I'm far from home
In a season of crime none need atone
I kissed your face
Sue, I've pushed you down beneath the weeds
Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face
I touched your face

[Bridge]
Sue, goodbye

[Outro]
Sue, I found your note
That you wrote last night
It can't be right
You went with him
Sue, I never dreamed
I'm such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clown
###Rock 'n' Roll Suicide###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Oh oh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 2]
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

[Verse 3]
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

[Chorus]
Oh no love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up
But if I could only make you care
Oh no love! You're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone!
Just turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone (wonderful)
Let's turn on and be not alone (wonderful)
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful (wonderful)
Oh gimme your hands
###Valentine's Day###David Bowie
[Verse 1]
Valentine told me who's to go
Feelings he's treasured most of all
The teachers and the football star
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine told me so
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day
The rhythm of the crowd
Teddy and Judy down

[Chorus]
Valentine sees it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day

[Verse 2]
Valentine told me how it feels
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand

[Chorus]
Valentine knows it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day

[Bridge]
(Yeah)
Valentine Valentine
(Yeah) (Woo) (Woo)
Valentine Valentine

[Outro]
It's in his scrawny hand
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine Valentine
It's in his scrawny hands
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine Valentine
###Baba O'Riley###The Who
[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven

[Interlude]

[Bridge: Pete Townshend]
Don't cry, don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
Sally, take my hand, we'll travel south 'cross land
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here, the happy ones are near
Let's get together before we get much older

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
Teenage wasteland, it's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland, oh, yeah
Teenage wasteland
They're all wasted!

[Instrumental]
###Behind Blue Eyes###The Who
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like
To be hated, to be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger, none of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man, to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
###Won't Get Fooled Again###The Who
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song

[Chorus]
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
And I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again

[Verse 2]
Change it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold that's all
But the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
Cause the banners, they all flown in the last war

[Chorus]
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a vow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
And I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
No, no!

[Bridge]
I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?

[Verse 3]
There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Is now the parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

[Chorus]
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
No, no!

[Synth solo]

[Outro]
YEAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss
###Pinball Wizard###The Who
[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
Ever since I was a young boy
I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
He stands like a statue
Becomes part of the machine
Feelin' all the bumpers
Always playin' clean
Plays by intuition
The digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus: Pete Townshend & Roger Daltrey]
He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's
Got such a supple wrist
How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
Ain't got no distractions
Can't hear no buzzers and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin'
Plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey & Pete Townshend]
I thought I was
The Bally table king
But I just handed
My pinball crown to him

[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]
Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball
###Who Are You###The Who
[Chorus 1: Pete Townshend & John Entwistle]
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?

[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said "You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away"
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

[Chorus 2: The Who]
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccupped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way
Oh wa oh wa oh wa oh wa

[Chorus 3: The Who]
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

[Chorus 4: Townshend & Entwistle]
Who are you?
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh
Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh

[Chorus 1: The Who]
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who are you?
Who, who, who, who?
Who  are you?
Who, who, who, who?

[Chorus 2: The Who]
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

[Outro: The Who]
Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me whoa are you(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me, tell me, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on, come on, who? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, tell me who are you (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really wanna know
Oh, I really wanna know
Come on tell me, who are you, you, you, you?
Who are you?
###My Generation###The Who
[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey (Pete Townshend & John Entwistle)]
People try to put us d-down (Talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just because we get around (Talkin' 'bout my generation)

And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest

Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box

Well the kids don't eat
And the dog can't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street

Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box

She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
She's playin' all night and the music's all right

###Eminence Front###The Who
[Verse 1]

The spray flies as the speedboat glides
And people forget
Forget they're hiding
The girls smile
And people forget
The snow packs as the skier tracks
And people forget
Forget they're hiding

[Chorus]
Behind an eminence front
Eminence front, it's a put on
It's an eminence front
It's an eminence front, it's a put on

The news slows
People forget
The shares crash, hopes are dashed
People forget
Forget they're hiding

[Chorus]
Behind an eminence front
Eminence front, it's a put on
It's just an eminence front
An eminence front, it's a put on
An eminence front
An eminence front, it's a put on

It's a put on, it's a put on, it's a put on

###I Can See For Miles###The Who
{Intro}

I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have cause, there's magic in my eyes

I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately you put things in my way

Well, here's a poke at you
You're going to choke on it too
You're going to lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

You took advantage of my trust in you when I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys and now you've got the nerve to say

That you still want me
Well, that's as may be
But you got to stand trial
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah

{Bridge}

I know you've deceived me, now here's a surprise
I know that you have cause there's magic in my eyes

The Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal are mine to see on clear days
You thought that I would need a crystal ball to see right through the haze

Well, here's a poke at you
You're going to choke on it too
You're going to lose that smile
Because all the while

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles

And miles and miles and miles and miles

I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles

###Substitute###The Who
{Instrumental Opening}

You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather

But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah

Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by

Substitute me for him
Substitute my coke for gin
Substitute you for my mum
At least I'll get my washing done

{Instrumental}

###We're Not Gonna Take It###The Who
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the camp
I guess you all know why we're here
My name is Tommy
And I became aware this year
If you want to follow me
You've got to play pinball
And put in your ear plugs
Put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork
Hey you getting drunk
So sorry, I got you sussed
Hey you smoking mother nature
This is a bust
Hey hung up old Mr. Normal
Don't try to gain my trust
Cause you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways
Although you think you must

[Chorus]
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
Never did and never will
We're not going to take it
Going to break it
Going to shake it
Let's forget it better still

[Bridge]
Now you can't hear me
Your ears are truly sealed
You can't speak either
Your mouth is filled
You can't see nothing
And pinball completes the scene
Here comes Uncle Ernie
To guide you to
Your very own machine

[Chorus]
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
Never did and never will
Don't want no religion
And as far as we can tell
We ain't gonna take you
Never did and never will
We forsake you
Gonna rape you
Let's forget you better still

[Bridge]
We forsake you
Going to rape you
Let's forget you better still
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me
See me, feel me
Touch me, heal me

[Verse 2]
Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story

[repeat until fade]
###1921###The Who
Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together

So you think '21
Is going to be a good year?
It could be good for me and her
But you and her, no, never!
I had no reason to be over optimistic
But somehow, when you smiled
I could brave bad weather

What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
He saw it all!

You didn't hear it
(I heard it)
You didn't see it
(I saw it)
You won't say nothing to no one
(I won't say nothing to no one)
Never in your life
(never in my life)
You never heard it
(I heard it)
How absurd it all seems
Without any proof
(How absurd it all seems without any proof)
You didn't hear it
(I heard it)
You didn't see it
(I saw it)
You never heard it, not a word of it!
(I heard it, every word of it)
You won't say nothing to no one
(I won't say nothing to no one)
Never tell a soul
What you know is the truth
(Never tell a soul
What I know is the truth)

Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
Got a feeling '21
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
I had no reason to be over-optimistic
But somehow, when you smiled
I could brave bad weather

What about the boy?
###My Wife###The Who
[Verse 1]
My life's in jeopardy
Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be
I ain't been home since Friday night
And now my wife is coming after me

Give me police protection
Gonna buy a gun so
I can look after number one
Give me a bodyguard
A black belt Judo expert with a machine gun

[Chorus]
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me
Won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car
Put on my lead boots
And take a long, long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But I'll still be alive

[Verse 2]
All I did was have a bit too much to drink
And I picked the wrong precinct
Got picked up by the law
And now I ain't got time to think

[Chorus]
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me
Won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car
Put on my lead boots
And take a long, long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But I'll still be alive

[Verse 3]
And I'm oh so tired of running
Gonna lay down on the floor
I gotta rest some time so
I can get to run some more

[Outro]
She's coming!
She's coming!
###Love Reign O'er Me###The Who
[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1]
Only love can make it rain
The way the beach is kissed by the sea
Only love can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers laying in the fields

[Chorus]
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me

[Verse 2]
Only love can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky
Only love can bring the rain
That falls like tears from on high

[Chorus]
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me
Rain o'er me

[Bridge]
On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spend apart alone
I need to get back home to cool cool rain
I can't sleep and I lay and I think
The night is hot and black as ink
Oh God, I need a drink of cool cool rain

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me, o'er me, o'er me!
Love reign o'er me
Rain o'er me

Tommy, can you hear me?
Can you feel me near you?

[Mother]
Tommy, can you see me?
Can I help to cheer you?

Tommy, Tommy, Tommy....
###Happy Jack###The Who
[Verse 1: John Entwistle]
Happy Jack wasn't old, but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man.
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle & Pete Townshend]
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied

[Verse 2: John Entwistle]
But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy

But they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

[Drum Solo: Keith Moon]

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle & Pete Townshend]
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied

[Verse 3: John Entwistle]
But they couldn't stop Jack, 'or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy

[Ad Libs: Pete Townshend]
I saw yer!
###The Kids Are Alright###The Who
[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey]
I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know 'em all pretty well

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright

[Verse 2: Roger Daltrey]
Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright

[Bridge: Roger Daltrey]
I know if I go, things would be a lot better for her
I had things planned, but her folks wouldn't let her

[Verse 3: Roger Daltrey]
I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know 'em all pretty well

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright

[Breakdown]

[Verse 4: Roger Daltrey]
Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away

[Chorus: Roger Daltrey]
And I know if I don't, I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
The kids are alright
###Amazing Journey###The Who
[Verse 1]
Deaf, dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems
His musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad

Ten years old
With thoughts as bold
As thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity

[Chorus]
Sickness can surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know

[Verse 2]
A vague haze of delirium
Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger
I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver-sparked
Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground

Nothing to say, and nothing to hear
And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony

[Chorus]

[Outro]
His eyes are the eyes
That transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride
###Fiddle About###The Who
[Uncle Ernie: Verse 1]
I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me
As I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about !

Your mother left me here to mind you
Now I'm doing what I want to
Fiddling about
Fiddling about
Fiddle about!

[Verse 2]
Down with the bedclothes
Up with the nightshirt!
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about !

You won't shout as I fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about
Fiddle about !
Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle

###Blowin' in the Wind###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

[Verse 2]
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

[Verse 3]
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?

[Refrain]
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
###Make You Feel My Love###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

[Verse 2]
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

[Verse 3]
I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

[Verse 4]
I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
I’d go crawling down the avenue
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love

[Verse 5]
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

[Verse 6]
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
###All Along the Watchtower###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth"

[Verse 2]
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too

[Verse 4]
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl
###Like a Rolling Stone###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all a'kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

[Chorus 1]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya' know ya' only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya' how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?"

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

[Chorus 3]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang out on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya' better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya', ya' can't refuse
When ya' ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya' got no secrets to conceal

[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
###The Times They Are A-Changin'###Bob Dylan
Come gather 'round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you’ll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you’ll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'

Come writers and critics, who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won’t come again
And don’t speak too soon
For the wheel’s still in spin
And there’s no tellin' who that it’s namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don’t stand in the doorway, don’t block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don’t criticize what you can’t understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get outta' the new one if you can’t lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'

The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'
###Hurricane###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”
Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 2]
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously
“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
“I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“One of us had better call up the cops”
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing
In the hot New Jersey night

[Verse 3]
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat

[Verse 4]
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said, “I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men

[Verse 5]
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says, “Why did you bring him in here for? He is not the guy!”
Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 6]
Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame
“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?”
“Don’t forget that you are white”

[Verse 7]
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
Cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we’re talking to your friend Bello
Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You’ll be doing society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”

[Verse 8]
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for pay
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse

[Verse 9]
All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

[Verse 10]
Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game

[Verse 11]
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
###Don't Think Twice, It's All Right###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1: Bob Dylan]
Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
You’re the reason I’m a-traveling on
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 2: Bob Dylan]
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 3: Bob Dylan]
So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can’t hear you anymore
I’m a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 4: Bob Dylan]
So long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could of done better, but I don’t mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
But don’t think twice, it’s all right
###Mr. Tambourine Man###Bob Dylan
[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 1]
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 2]
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 3]
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

[Verse 4]
And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

[Chorus]
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you
###Tempest###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

[Verse 2]
T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold

[Verse 3]
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

[Verse 4]
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

[Verse 5]
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love

[Verse 6]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld

[Verse 7]
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

[Verse 8]
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

[Verse 9]
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long

[Verse 10]
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep

[Verse 11]
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

[Verse 12]
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

[Verse 13]
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

[Verse 14]
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

[Verse 15]
Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last

[Verse 16]
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

[Verse 17]
The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

[Verse 18]
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

[Verse 19]
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

[Verse 20]
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

[Verse 21]
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

[Verse 22]
Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

[Verse 23]
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

[Verse 24]
The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life

[Verse 25]
Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark

[Verse 26]
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

[Verse 27]
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

[Verse 28]
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, "The poor are yours to feed"

[Verse 29]
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

[Verse 30]
Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

[Verse 31]
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

[Verse 32]
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

[Verse 33]
Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

[Verse 34]
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

[Verse 35]
Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

[Verse 36]
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

[Verse 37]
There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

[Verse 38]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

[Verse 39]
The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

[Verse 40]
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race

[Verse 41]
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

[Verse 42]
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

[Verse 43]
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand

[Verse 44]
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

[Verse 45]
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea
###Subterranean Homesick Blues###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
Johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
Wants eleven dollar bills – you only got ten

[Verse 2]
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bet book
Phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says "The Man, he say
They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A."
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

[Verse 3]
Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters

[Verse 4]
Oh, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed
Get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles
###To Fall In Love With You###Bob Dylan
A tear goes down my day is real
But your drying eye upon the shame
Each needs a road for me from you
What paradise? what can I do?
That die for my and the day is dark
I can’t believe for your touch
What I could find oh time is right
If I fell in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you

The day is dark, our time is right
Day in the night deep in the night
I can’t yet be back I heard my- surprise
I see it in your lips I knew it in your eyes
Well I feel your love and I feel no shame
I can’t unleash your horde I call your name
What you’re to me what can I do?
To fall in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you

It just rolls upon the sand
Ever this for now I’m made a man
Can make you see what I can find
I know it in my days ah in my daily mind
Oh will ages roll will ages fly?
I hear your name where angels lie
What do I know? for to come it’s true
To fall in love To fall in love
To fall in love with you

How can the doors trust on a nail?
How can I be surprised of most every day?
In the distant road I can’t be the same
I feel no love I feel no shame
I can’t watch the bay out on my own
We’ve a destined man I can attest it all
I didn’t I could find where I could go
To fall in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you
###Masters of War###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
Come, you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

[Verse 2]
You that never done nothing
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

[Verse 3]
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

[Verse 4]
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
While the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
While the young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

[Verse 5]
You’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

[Verse 6]
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

[Verse 7]
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

[Verse 8]
And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I will follow your casket
By the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand over your grave
'Til I’m sure that you’re dead
###Desolation Row###Bob Dylan
They’re selling postcards of the hanging
They’re painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They’ve got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad, they’re restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

Cinderella, she seems so easy
It takes one to know one, she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning
“You Belong to Me I Believe”
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend
You'd better leave”
And the only sound that’s left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
He’s getting ready for the show
He’s going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession’s her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah’s great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They’re trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
“Have Mercy on His Soul”
They all play on the pennywhistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
They’re getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls
“Get outta here if you don’t know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row”

At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero’s Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody’s shouting
“Which side are you on?”
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain’s tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row

Yes, I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the doorknob broke)
When you asked me how I was doing
Or's that some kinda joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can’t read too good
Don’t send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row
###Tangled Up in Blue###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 2]
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
"We'll meet again someday
On the avenue"
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 3]
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 4]
She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in back of my chair
Said to me "Don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 5]
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello" she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 6]
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 7]
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue
###A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 2]
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 3]
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 4]
Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 5]
And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner’s face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I’ll know my song well before I start singing

[Chorus]
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
###Knockin' On Heaven's Door###Bob Dylan
[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 1]
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can’t use it anymore
It’s getting dark, too dark to see
I feel I’m knocking on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Just like so many times before

[Verse 2]
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can’t shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down
I feel I’m knocking on heaven’s door

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Just like so many times before

[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Just like so many times before

[Outro]
Just like so many times before
Just like so many times before
Just like so many times before
Just like so many times before
Just like so many times before
Just like so many times before
Just like so many times before
Just like so many times before
Just like so many times before
###It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

[Verse 2]
Pointed threats they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying

[Verse 3]
Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan, but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more
Person crying

[Chorus]
So don't fear
If you hear
A foreign sound
To your ear
It's alright, Ma
I'm only sighing

[Verse 4]
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons, great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

[Verse 5]
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without lookin' too far
That not much is really sacred

[Verse 6]
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

[Chorus]
And though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it

[Verse 7]
Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime, life outside goes on
All around you

[Verse 8]
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand, with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

[Verse 9]
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he, or she, or them, or it
That you belong to

[Chorus]
But though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to

[Verse 10]
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destiny
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something they invest in

[Verse 11]
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And say "God bless him"

[Verse 12]
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in

[Chorus]
But I mean no harm, nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

[Verse 13]
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

[Verse 14]
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon 'em naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

[Verse 15]
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say, okay, I've had enough
What else can you show me?

[Chorus]
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only
###It's All Over Now, Baby Blue###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

[Chorus]
Look out, the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 2]
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

[Chorus]
The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 3]
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies are going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor

[Chorus]
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 4]
Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

[Chorus]
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
###Girl from the North Country###Bob Dylan
[Verse 1]
If you’re travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

[Verse 2]
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

[Verse 3]
Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
For that’s the way I remember her best

[Verse 4]
I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I’ve often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

[Verse 5]
So if you’re travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
###Visions Of Johanna###Bob Dylan
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doing our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play Blind Man's Bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the D-train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise she's all right she's just near
She's delicate and seems like veneer
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have not taken my place

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, "This is what salvation must be like after awhile"
But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez
I can't find my knees"
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Saying, "Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him"
But like Louise always says
"You can't look at much, can you man?"
As she, herself prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes "Everything's been returned which was owed"
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain
###Nothing Else Matters###Metallica
[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 2]
So close no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
So close no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters
###One###Metallica
[Instrumental Intro]

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Short Instrumental Break]

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Short Instrumental Break]

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God help me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

[Instrumental Break]

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

[Instrumental Outro]
###Enter Sandman###Metallica
[Verse 1]
Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Until the sandman he comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land

[Verse 2]
Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war
Dreams of liars
Dreams of dragons fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Now I lay me down to sleep
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the lord my soul to keep
(Pray the lord my soul to keep)
And
If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the lord my soul to take
(Pray the lord my soul to take)

[Bridge]
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet, in your head

[Chorus]
Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

[Interlude]
Come on people
Hey yeah, oh oh yeah

[Outro]
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
###Master of Puppets###Metallica
[Verse 1]
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your...

[Chorus]
Master! Master!
Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!

[Verse 2]
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your...

[Chorus]
Master! Master!
Master of Puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!

[Post-Chorus]
(Master, master, master, master...)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge]
Master! Master! Where’s the dreams that I’ve been after?
Master! Master! You promised only lies
Laughter! Laughter! All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter! Laughter! Laughing at my cries
Fix me!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now, your life is out of season

[Refrain]
I will occupy, I will help you die
I will run through you, now I rule you too

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your...

[Chorus]
Master! Master!
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master! Master!
###The Unforgiven###Metallica
[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
New blood joins this Earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"

[Guitar Solo: Kirk Hammett]

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Whoa

[Outro: James Hetfield]
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
You labeled me, I'll label you
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
Never free, never me
So I dub thee "Unforgiven"
###Fade to Black###Metallica
[Verse 1]
Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

[Verse 2]
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

[Bridge]
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think... think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye...

[Instrumental Outro]
###For Whom the Bell Tolls###Metallica
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right
Yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill
Why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

[Chorus]
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

[Verse 2]
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

[Chorus]
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

[Outro]
###Sad but True###Metallica
[Verse 1]
Hey (Hey), I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey (Hey), I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They (They), they betray
I'm your only true friend now
They (They), they'll betray
I'm forever there

[Chorus]
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
Sad but true

[Verse 2]
You (You), you're my mask
You're my cover my shelter
You (You), you're my mask
You're the one who's blamed
Do (Do), do my work
Do my dirty work scapegoat
Do (Do), do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed

[Chorus]
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
Sad but true

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I'm your dream
I'm your eyes
I'm your pain
I'm your dream (I'm your dream)
I'm your eyes (I'm your eyes)
I'm your pain (I'm your pain)
You know it's sad but true

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hate (Hate), I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
Pay (Pay), pay the price
Pay for nothing's fair
Hey (Hey), I'm your life
I'm the one who took you there
Hey (Hey), I'm your life
And I no longer care

[Chorus]
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your recent alibis
I'm inside, open your eyes
I'm you
Sad but true
###Atlas, Rise!###Metallica
[Verse 1]
Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity
Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, feign perception
Grudges break your back

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

[Verse 2]
Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?
Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down
Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

[Pre-Chorus]
All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

[Chorus]
Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!
How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!
###Wherever I May Roam###Metallica
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
(And the road becomes my bride)
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need
And the dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah

[Verse 2]
(And the Earth becomes my throne)
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I have grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one!
And my ties are severed clean
Less I have the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
Yeah you will!

[Chorus]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah
That's right

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll take my time anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right
Right here, right now

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home
Carved upon my stone
My body lies, but still, I roam yeah yeah

[Outro]
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam, roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam, yeah
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander!
Wherever I may roam, yeah yeah
Wherever I may roam, yeah yeah
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
###Welcome Home (Sanitarium)###Metallica
[Verse 1]
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage?"

[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Build my fear of what's out there
I cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Bridge]
Sanitarium
(Just leave me alone)

[Outro]
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again
###Creeping Death###Metallica
[Verse 1]
Slaves, Hebrews born to serve
To the Pharaoh
Heed to his every word
Live in fear
Faith, of the unknown one
The deliverer
Wait, something must be done
Four hundred years

[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

[Verse 2]
Now, let my people go
Land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee
Bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong
Down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long
Hail to fire

[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Die, by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man
Die, by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man

[Verse 3]
I rule the midnight air
The destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there
Deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor
Final darkness
Blood, lambs blood painted door
I shall pass

[Chorus]
So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death
###Battery###Metallica
[Verse 1]
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery has found in me
Battery
Battery

[Verse 2]
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery has found in me
Battery
Battery

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery has found in me
Battery
Battery
Battery
Battery
###Hardwired###Metallica
[Verse 1]
In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Gone insane

[Chorus]
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

[Verse 2]
On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer
Doom design

[Chorus]
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

[Verse 3]
Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading?
Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating?
In the end

[Chorus]
We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct
###...And Justice for All###Metallica
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

[Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Verse 2]
Apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity, so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

[Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Lady justice has been raped, truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again, make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel

[Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
We pay
Nothing can save us
Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Outro]
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real
###Blackened###Metallica
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mend
Never

[Chorus 1]
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Verse 2]
Blistering of Earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore
Never

[Chorus 1]
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Post-Chorus]
Blackened!

[Bridge]
Opposition (opposition)
Contradiction (contradiction)
Premonition (premonition)
Compromise
Agitation (agitation)
Violation (violation)
Mutilation (mutilation)
Planet dies
Darkest color
Blistered Earth
True death of life

(Termination) termination
(Expiration) expiration
(Cancellation) cancellation human race
(Expectation) expectation

(Population) population lay to waste
See our mother
Put to death
See our mother die

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears
Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun
Never

[Chorus 2]
Fire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Fire
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackened

[Post-Chorus]
Blackened!
###The Unforgiven II###Metallica
[Verse 1]
Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, than I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah!
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, because I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Verse 2]
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, But she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah!
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, because I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Verse 3]
Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes now I see it...

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah!
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, because I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah!
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, because I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Outro]
I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me
Because you're unforgiven too
Oh, oh, oh
###Seek & Destroy###Metallica
[Intro]
Alright

[Verse 1]
We're scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you, to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothing new, you know it drives us insane

[Pre-Chorus]
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths

[Chorus]
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy

[Verse 2]
There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You always been taking and now you're giving

[Pre-Chorus]
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths

[Chorus]
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!

[Verse 3]
Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find

[Pre-Chorus]
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths

[Chorus]
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy!
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy, a-ha ha ha
###Now That We're Dead###Metallica
[Verse 1]
When darkness falls, may it be
That we should see the light
When reaper calls, may it be
That we walk straight and right
When doubt returns, may it be
That faith shall permeate our scars
When we’re seduced, then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

[Pre-Chorus]
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

[Chorus 1]
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

[Verse 2]
When all is pain, may it be
It’s all we’ve ever known
When flame consumes, may it be
It warms our dying bones
When loss has won, may it be
It’s you I’m madly fighting for
When kingdom comes, may it be
We walk right through that open door

[Pre-Chorus]
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

[Chorus 1]
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

[Chorus 2]
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

[Outro]
Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live forever
###The Day That Never Comes###Metallica
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Born to push you 'round, better just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies, tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep praying, just keep waiting

[Chorus]
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes, no
No, the son shine never comes

[Verse 2]
Push you cross that line, just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay, take it back one day
I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray

[Chorus]
Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the son shine never comes, no

[Bridge]
Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison
I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear, the sun will shine
This, I swear! This, I swear!
This! I! Swear!

[Instrumental Outro]
###One###U2
[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

[Chorus]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

[Final Chorus]
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh
May we, may we, may we get
Higher
Oh, higher
(Ay, yeah, go) higher
(Oh) Higher
###With or Without You###U2
[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you

[Verse 2]
Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ah-ah
I can't live with or without you

[Bridge]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

[Verse 3]
My hands are tied, my body bruised
She got me with nothing to win
And nothing left to lose

[Bridge]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you

With or without you
With or without you, ohh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you
###I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For###U2
[Verse 1]
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her finger tips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

[Verse 3]
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds
And you loosed the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Oh my shame, you know I believe it

[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
###Sunday Bloody Sunday###U2
[Verse 1]
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? How long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Alright, let's go!

[Verse 2]
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me, who has won?
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

[Bridge]
How long
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Come get some!

[Bridge]
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your bloodshot eyes

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

[Verse 3]
And it's true, we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today, the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow, they die
The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
On—

[Chorus]
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
###Get Out of Your Own Way###U2
[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, hey, hey
Get out of your own way, hey, hey

[Verse 1: Bono]
Love hurts
Now you're the girl who's left with no words
Your heart's a balloon, but then it bursts
It doesn't take a cannon, just a pin
Your skin's not covering
And resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

[Verse 2: Bono]
Fight back
Don't take it lyin' down, you got to bite back
The face of liberty's starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got smacked in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are lookin' for someone to lead them
The master's lookin' for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincoln's ghost said...

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way, oh, I
Get out of your own way, oh, I

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus: Bono]
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the arrogant
For there is the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain
###Song for Someone###U2
[Verse 1]
You got a face not spoiled by beauty
I have some scars from where I've been
You've got eyes that can see right through me
You're not afraid of anything they've seen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was told that I would feel
Nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal
But in you I found a rhyme

[Chorus 1]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark that we shouldn't doubt
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, song for someone
This is a song, song for someone

[Verse 2]
You let me in to a conversation
A conversation only we could make
You're breaking into my imagination
Whatever's in there it's yours to take

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was told I would feel
Nothing the first time
You were slow to heal
But this could be the night

[Chorus 2]
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a dark within and without
And there is a light, don't let it go out

And this is a song, song for someone
This is a song, a song for someone

[Outro]
And I'm a long long way from your hill of Calvary
And I'm a long way from where I was, where I need to be
If there is a light you can't always see
And there is a world we can't always be
If there is a kiss I stole from your mouth
And there is a light, don't let it go out
###Every Breaking Wave###U2
[Verse 1]
Every breaking wave on the shore
Tells the next one there'll be one more
Every gambler knows that to lose
It's what you're really there for
Summer I was fearlessness
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

[Chorus]
If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

[Verse 2]
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
Every shipwrecked soul, knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
It's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

[Chorus]
###You're The Best Thing About Me###U2
[Verse 1: Bono]
When you look so good, the pain in your face doesn't show
When you look so good and baby, you don't even know
When the world is ours but the world is not your kind of thing
Full of shooting stars, brighter as they're vanishing
Oh you've seen enough to know it's children who teach
You're still free enough to wake up on a bed or a beach

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me
The best thing about me

[Verse 2: Bono]
I been crying out, "How bad can a good time be?"
Shooting off my mouth, that's another great thing about me
I have everything but I feel like nothing at all
There's no risky thing for a man who's determined to fall

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best thing that ever happened a boy
You're the best thing about me
I'm the kind of trouble that you enjoy
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?

[Bridge: The Edge]
I can see it all so clearly
I can see what you can't see
I can see you love her loudly
When she needs you quietly

[Chorus: Bono]
You're the best thing about me
The best things are easy to destroy
You're the best thing about me

[Post-Chorus: Bono]
Why am I
Why am I walking away?
Walking away
Why am I walking away?
###Pride (In the Name of Love)###U2
[Verse 1]
One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Verse 2]
One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Interlude]
Nothing like love
There's nothing like love
Nobody like you

[Verse 3]
Early morning, April 4
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

[Chorus]
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
###Beautiful Day###U2
[Verse 1]
The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town
You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

[Verse 2]
You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of her imagination
You love this town
Even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

[Bridge]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Verse 3]
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

[Bridge]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

[Verse 4]
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day
###The Troubles###U2
[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control

[Verse 1: Bono]
You think it’s easier
To put your finger on the trouble
When the trouble is you
And you think it’s easier
To know your own tricks
Well it’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do

[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and then hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you’re not my troubles anymore

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control

[Verse 2: Bono]
You think it’s easier
To give up on the trouble
If the trouble is destroying you
You think it’s easier
But before you threw me a rope
It was the one thing I could hold on to

[Pre-Chorus: Bono & Lykke Li]
I have a will for survival
So you can hurt me and then hurt me some more
I can live with denial
But you’re not my troubles anymore

[Chorus: Lykke Li & (Bono)]
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Somebody stepped inside your soul
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control (till someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control

[Verse 3: Bono & Lykke Li]
God knows it’s not easy
I'm taking on the shape of someone else’s pain
God now you can see me
I’m naked and I’m not afraid, my body’s
Sacred and I’m not ashamed

[Chorus: Lykke Li & (Bono)]
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till somebody else was in control (till someone else is in control)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Somebody stepped inside your soul (oh no)
Little by little they robbed and stole
Till someone else was in control (someone else is in control)
###American Soul###U2
[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward

[Verse 1: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Bridge 1: Bono]
Look around, look around
Look around, it's a sound
Look around, look around
It's a sound

[Verse 2: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a thought
That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul

[Verse 3: Bono]
It's not a place
This is a dream the whole world owns
The pilgrim's face
It had your heart to call her home

[Refrain]
Hold on Brother John
Too many mothers weepin'
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you can't be sleepin'

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
American
American

[Bridge 2: Bono]
Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late, but we still gotta try
There's a moment in our life where a soul can die
And the person in a country when you believe the lie
The lie (the lie, the lie)
There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action, not to fantasy
The end of a dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be our sanctuary
Refu-Jesus

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
American soul
American soul
###Ordinary Love###U2
[Verse 1]
The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again

I can't fight you anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rock together
But time leaves us polished stones

[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

[Verse 2]
Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and I
We'll build our house in the trees

Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe
That the world couldn't wash it away

[Chorus]
'Cause we can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

[Bridge]
Are we tough enough
For ordinary love

[Chorus]
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
And we cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
###The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)###U2
[Verse 1]
I was chasing down the days of fear
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
I was aching to be somewhere near
Your voice was all I heard
I was shaking from a storm in me
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
Above the noise, above the hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus 1]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

[Verse 2]
We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name

[Pre-Chorus]
I was young
Not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you
Brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

[Chorus 1]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost, now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

[Bridge]
We can hear you
We can hear you
We can hear you

[Chorus 2]
I woke up at the moment when the miracle had come
I get so many things I don't deserve
All the stolen voices will some day be returned
The most beautiful sound I ever heard

[Outro]
Your voices will be heard
Your voices will be heard
###Sleep Like a Baby Tonight###U2
[Verse 1]
Morning, your toast, your tea and sugar
Read about the politician's lover
Go through the day like knife through butter
Why don't you
You dress in the colors of forgiveness
Your eyes as red as Christmas
Purple robes are folded on the kitchen chair

[Chorus]
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like someone else's suicide
You're gonna sleep like a  baby tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreams
It's a dirty business, dreaming
Where there is silence and not screaming
Where there's no daylight, there's no healing

[Chorus]
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight

[Bridge]
Hope is where the door is
When the church is where the war is
Where no one can feel no one else's pain

[Chorus]
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
In your dreams, everything is alright
Tomorrow dawns like a suicide
But you're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
Sleep like a baby tonight
Like a bird, your dreams take flight
Like St Francis covered in light
You're gonna sleep like a baby tonight
###Summer of Love###U2
[Verse 1]
The winter
Doesn't want you
It haunts you
Summer serenadings
A long way
From this frozen place
Your face
Our teacher
Our preacher
It's nature
And like flowers growing in a bomb crater
From nothing
A rose
It grows

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

[Verse 2]
We're freezing
We're leaving
Believing
That all we need is to head over somewhere
In a summer
To come
So we run

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
We're sick of living in the shadows
We have one more chance before the light goes
For a summer of love
A summer of love

[Bridge]
Oh and when all is lost
When all is lost we find out what remains
Oh the same oceans crossed
For some it’s pleasure, for some it’s pain

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about the West Coast
Not the one that everyone knows
In the rubble of Aleppo
Flowers blooming in the shadows
For a summer of love
A summer of love
###Where The Streets Have No Name###U2
[Verse 1]
I wanna run, I want to hide
I wanna tear down the walls
That hold me inside
I wanna reach out
And touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust-cloud
Disappear without a trace
I wanna take shelter
From the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name

[Bridge]
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

[Verse 3]
The city's a flood, and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in dust
I'll show you a place
High on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name

[Bridge]
We're still building and burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do

[Verse 4]
Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh and I see love
See our love turn to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh when I go there
I go there with you
It's all I can do
###Invisible###U2
It’s like the room just cleared of smoke
I didn't even want the heart you broke
It’s yours to keep
You just might need one

I finally found my real name
I won’t be me when you see me again
No, I won’t be my father’s son

[Chorus]
I’m more than you know
I’m more than you see here
More than you let me be
I’m more than you know
A body in a soul
You don’t see me but you will
I am not invisible

(That's right
I’ll be in the invisible world)

I don’t dream, not as such
I don’t even think about you that much
Unless I start to think at all

All those frozen days
And your frozen ways
They melt away your face like snow

[Chorus]
I’m more than you know
I’m more than you see here
I’m more than you let me be
I’m more than you know
A body in a soul
You don’t see me but you will
I am not invisible
I am here

[Outro]
There is no them
There is no them
There’s only us
There’s only us
There is no them
There is no them
There’s only us
There’s only us
There is no them
There is no them
There’s only you
And there’s only me
There is no them
###Love is Bigger Than Anything in its Way###U2
[Verse 1]
The door is open to go through
If I could I would come too
But the path is made by you
As you're walking start singing and stop talking

[Chorus]
Oh, if I could hear myself when I say
Oh, love is bigger than anything in its way

[Verse 2]
So young to be the words of your own song
I know the rage in you is strong
Write a world where we can belong
To each other and sing it like no other

[Chorus]
Oh, if I could hear myself when I say
Oh, love is bigger than anything in its way

[Bridge]
If the moonlight caught you crying on Killiney Bay
Oh sing your song
Let your song be sung
If you listen you can hear the silence say
When you think you're done
You've just begun

[Outro]
Love is bigger than anything in its way
Love is bigger than anything in its way
Love is bigger than anything in its way
###Iris (Hold Me Close)###U2
[Verse 1]
The star
That gives us light
Has been gone a while
But it's not an illusion
The ache
In my heart
Is so much a part of who I am
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years to get here
Something in your eyes
Took a thousand years, a thousand years

[Chorus]
Hold me close, hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close the darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I’ve got your light inside of me
Iris... Iris...

[Verse 2]
Once we are born, we begin to forget
The very reason we came
But you
I'm sure I've met
Long before the night the stars went out
We're meeting up again

[Chorus]
Hold me close, hold me close and don't let me go
Hold me close like I'm someone that you might know
Hold me close, the darkness just lets us see
Who we are
I've got your light inside of me
Iris... Iris...

[Bridge]
The stars are bright but do they know
The universe is beautiful but cold

You took me by the hand
I thought that I was leading you
But it was you made me your man
Machine
I dream
Where you are
Iris standing in the hall
She tells me I can do it all
Iris wakes to my nightmares
Don't fear the world it isn't there

Iris playing on the strand
She buries the boy beneath the sand
Iris says that I will be the death of her
It was not me

Iris... Iris...

She says
Free yourself, to be yourself if only you could see yourself
Free yourself, to be yourself if only you could see...
###Riders on the Storm###The Doors
[Chorus]
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm

[Verse 1]
There's a killer on the road
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
Take a long holiday
Let your children play
If you give this man a ride
Sweet family will die
Killer on the road

[Verse 2]
Girl you gotta love your man
Girl you gotta love your man
Take him by the hand
Make him understand
The world on you depends
Our life will never end
Gotta love your man

[Chorus]
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Into this house we're born
Into this world we're thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan

[Outro]
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
###The End###The Doors
[Intro]

[Chorus]
This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend
The end

[Verse 1]
Of our elaborate plans, the end
Of everything that stands, the end
No safety or surprise, the end
I'll never look into your eyes again

[Verse 2]
Can you picture what will be?
So limitless and free
Desperately in need
Of some stranger's hand
In a desperate land

[Verse 3]
Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain
And all the children are insane
All the children are insane
Waiting for the summer rain, yeah

[Verse 4]
There's danger on the edge of town
Ride the King's Highway, baby
Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby
Ride the snake, ride the snake
To the lake, the ancient lake, baby
The snake, he's long, seven miles
Ride the snake
He's old and his skin is cold
The west is the best
The west is the best
Get here and we'll do the rest
The blue bus is calling us
The blue bus is calling us
Driver, where you taking us?

[Verse 5]
The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door
And he looked inside
"Father?" "Yes, son?" "I want to kill you"
"Mother? I want to..."

[Bridge]
Come on baby, take a chance with us
Come on baby, take a chance with us
Come on baby, take a chance with us
And meet me at the back of the blue bus
Of the blue bus, on the blue bus, on the blue bus
Come on yeah
Fuck, fuck
Fuck fuck, fuck, fuck
Come on baby, fuck me baby yeah
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Come on baby, fuck me baby
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Come on
Fuck fuck
Alright
Fuck fuck
Kill, kill, kill, kill

[Chorus]
This is the end
Beautiful friend
This is the end
My only friend, the end

[Verse 6]
It hurts to set you free
But you'll never follow me
The end of laughter and soft lies
The end of nights we tried to die
This is the end
###Light My Fire###The Doors
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

[Verse 2]
The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah...

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire

[Outro]
###People Are Strange###The Doors
People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange

People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange
Alright, yeah

When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange
###L.A. Woman###The Doors
[Verse: Jim Morrison]
Well, I just got into town about an hour ago
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows
Are you a lucky little lady from The City of Lights?
Or just another lost angel?
City of Night, City of Night
City of Night, City of Night
L.A. woman, L.A. woman
L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon
L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon
L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon
Drive through your suburbs
Into your blues, into your blues, yeah
Into your blues, into your blues!
I see your hair is burning
Hills are filled with fire
If they say I never loved you
You know they are a liar
Driving down your freeways
Midnight alleys roam
Cops in cars, the topless bars
Never saw a woman so alone
So alone, so alone
Motel money murder-madness
Let's change the mood from glad to sadness

[Outro]
Mr. Mojo Risin', Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin', Mr. Mojo Risin'
Got to keep on risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin', Mr. Mojo Risin'
Mojo Risin', gotta Mojo Risin'
Mr. Mojo Risin', gotta keep on risin'
Risin', risin'
Gone risin', risin'
I'm gone risin', risin'
I gotta risin', risin'
Well, risin', risin'
I gotta, wooo, yeah, risin'
Whoa, oh yeah

Well, I just got into town about an hour ago
Took a look around, see which way the wind blow
Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows

Are you a lucky little lady in The City of Lights?
Or just another lost angel?
City of Night, City of Night
City of Night, City of Night, whoa, c'mon

L.A. Woman, L.A. Woman
L.A. Woman, you're my woman
Little L.A. Woman, Little L.A. Woman
L.A. L.A. Woman Woman
L.A. Woman c'mon
###Break On Through (To the Other Side)###The Doors
[Verse 1]
You know the day destroys the night
Night divides the day
Tried to run
Tried to hide

[Chorus]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side, yeah

[Verse 2]
We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
But can't you still recall
The time we cried

[Chorus]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side

[Bridge]
Everybody loves my baby
Everybody loves my baby
She gets high
She gets high
She gets high
She gets high, yeah

[Verse 3]
I found an island in your arms
Country in your eyes
Arms that chain
Eyes that lie

[Chorus]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through oh, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Made the scene
Week to week
Day to day
Hour to hour
The gate is strait
Deep and wide

[Outro]
Break on through to the other side
Break on through to the other side
Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Break on through
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
###The Crystal Ship###The Doors
[Verse]
Before you slip into unconsciousness
I'd like to have another kiss
Another flashing chance at bliss
Another kiss, another kiss

The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was too insane
We'll meet again, we'll meet again

Oh tell me where your freedom lies
The streets are fields that never die
Deliver me from reasons why
You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly

The crystal ship is being filled
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
A million ways to spend your time
When we get back, I'll drop a line
###Roadhouse Blues###The Doors
Oh keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel
Yeah, we're going to the Roadhouse
Gonna have a real
A good time

Yeah, the back of the Roadhouse they got some bungalows
Yeah, the back of the Roadhouse they got some bungalows

All night long

Cancel my subscription to the Resurrection
Send my credentials to the House of Detention
I got some friends inside

The face in the mirror won't stop
The girl in the window won't drop
A feast of friends, "Alive!" she cried
Waiting for me outside

Before I sink into the big sleep
I want to hear
I want to hear
The scream of the butterfly

Come back baby
Back into my arm
We're gettin' tired of hangin' around
Waitin' around with our heads to the ground
I hear a very gentle sound

Very near yet, very far
Very soft yeah, very clear
Come today, come today

What have they done to the earth?
What have they done to our fair sister?
Ravaged and plundered and ripped her and bit her
Stuck her with knives in the side of the dawn
And tied her with fences and dragged her down

I hear a very gentle sound
With your ear down to the ground
We want the world and we want it
We want the world and we want it
Now
Now?
Now!

Persian night babe
See the light babe
Save us
Jesus
Save us

So when the music's over
When the music's over, yeah

###The Soft Parade###The Doors
When I was back there in seminary school
There was a person there
Who put forth the proposition
That you can petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the lord with prayer
Petition the lord with prayer
You cannot petition the lord with prayer!

Can you give me sanctuary
I must find a place to hide
A place for me to hide

Can you find me soft asylum
I can't make it anymore
The Man is at the door

Peppermint, miniskirts, chocolate candy
Champion sax and a girl named Sandy
There's only four ways to get unraveled
One is to sleep and the other is travel, da da
One is a bandit up in the hills
One is to love your neighbor 'till
His wife gets home

Catacombs
Nursery bones
Winter women
Growing stones
Carrying babies
To the river

Streets and shoes
Avenues
Letter writers
Selling news
The monk bought lunch

Ha ha, he bought a little
Yes, he did
Woo!
This is the best part of the trip
This is the trip, the best part
I really like
What'd he say?
Yeah!
Yeah, right!
Pretty good, huh
Huh!
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number

Successful hills are here to stay
Everything must be this way
Gentle streets where people play
Welcome to the Soft Parade

All our lives we sweat and save
Building for a shallow grave
Must be something else we say
Somehow to defend this place
Everything must be this way
Everything must be this way, yeah

The Soft Parade has now begun
Listen to the engines hum
People out to have some fun
A cobra on my left
Leopard on my right, yeah

The deer woman in a silk dress
Girls with beads around their necks
Kiss the hunter of the green vest
Who has wrestled before
With lions in the night

Out of sight!
The lights are getting brighter
The radio is moaning
Calling to the dogs
There are still a few animals
Left out in the yard
But it's getting harder
To describe sailors
To the underfed

Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
What got us this far
To this mild equator?

We need someone or something new
Something else to get us through, yeah, come on

Calling on the dogs
Calling on the dogs
Oh, it's getting harder
Calling on the dogs
Calling in the dogs
Calling all the dogs
Calling on the gods

You got to meet me
Too late, baby
Slay a few animals
At the crossroads
Too late
All in the yard
But it's getting harder
By the crossroads
You got to meet me
Oh, we're going, we're going great
At the edge of town
Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
Having a good time
Got to come along
What got us this far
To this mild equator?
Outskirts of the city
You and I
We need someone new
Something new
Something else to get us through
Better bring your gun
Better bring your gun
Tropic corridor
Tropic treasure
We're going to ride and have some fun

When all else fails
We can whip the horse's eyes
And make them sleep
And cry
###Love Her Madly###The Doors

Don't ya need her badly?
Don't ya love her ways?

Seven horses seem to be on the mark

[Chorus]
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game

[Verse 1]
She's walking down the street
Blind to every eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy
To make the queen of the angels sigh?

[Chorus]
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you
Won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you
Let me jump in your game

[Verse 2]
She holds her head so high
Like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long
When she moves my brain screams out this song

Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

[Outro]
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello
I want you
Hello
I need my baby
Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello...

But we got the numbers
Gonna win, yeah

Come on!

Your ballroom days are over, baby
Night is drawing near
Shadows of the evening

Ya walk across the floor with a flower in your hand
Trying to tell me no one understands
Trade in your hours for a handful dimes
Gonna' make it, baby, in our prime

[Chorus]
Come together one more time

Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah

###Soul Kitchen###The Doors
[Verse 1]
Well, the clock says it's time to close now
I guess I'd better go now
I'd really like to stay here all night
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes
Street lights shed their hollow glow
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise
Still one place to go
Still one place to go

[Chorus]
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves

[Verse 2]
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget, learn to forget
Learn to forget, learn to forget

[Chorus]
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves

[Outro]
Well the clock says it's time to close now
I know I have to go now
I really want to stay here
All night, all night, all night
###Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)###The Doors
[Verse 1]
Well, show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
Show me the way
To the next whiskey bar
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
For if we don't find
The next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you we must die

[Chorus]
Oh, moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why

[Verse 2]
Show me the way to the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why
Oh, don't ask why
Show me the way to the next little girl
Oh, don't ask why

The next little girl
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die

We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey, oh, you know why
###Peace Frog###The Doors
There's blood in the streets it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets it's up to my knee (She came)
Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago (She came)
Blood on the rise it's following me (She came)
Think about the break of day
She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

Blood in the streets runs a river of sadness (She came)
Blood in the streets it's up to my thigh (She came)
Yeah the river runs red down the legs of a city (She came)
The women are crying red rivers of weepin' (She came)
She came in town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair

Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind

Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of fantastic L.A

Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union

There's blood in the streets it's up to my ankles
Blood in the streets it's up to my knee
Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago
Blood on the rise it's following me
###Love Me Two Times###The Doors
Love me two times baby
Love me twice today
Love me two times girl
I'm goin' away
Love me two times girl
One for tomorrow
One just for today
Love me two times
I'm goin' away

Love me one time
I could not speak
Love me one time
Yeah my knees got weak
But love me two times girl
Last me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away

Oh yes !

Love me one time
Could not speak
Love me one time day babe
Yeah my knees got weak
Love me two times girl
Last me all through the week
Love me two times
I'm goin' away

Love me two times babe
Love me twice today
Love me two times babe
Just I'm goin' away
Love me two times girl
One for tomorrow
One just for today
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
Love me two times
I'm goin' away
###Moonlight Drive###The Doors
Let's swim to the moon, uh huh
Let's climb through the tide
Penetrate the evening that the
City sleeps to hide
Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our turn to try
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon, uh huh
Let's climb through the tide
Surrender to the waiting worlds
That lap against our side
Nothing left open
And no time to decide
We've stepped into a river
On our moonlight drive

Let's swim to the moon
Let's climb through the tide
You reach your hand to hold me
But I can't be your guide
Easy, I love you
As I watch you glide
Falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive, baby
Moonlight drive

Come on baby, gonna take a little ride
Down, down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight
Baby gonna drown tonight
Goin' down, down, down
###Celebration of the Lizard King###The Doors
Lions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town

He went down South and crossed the border
Left chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder

One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shining skin
Is everybody in?
Is everybody in?
Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin

Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?

The snake was pale gold
Glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisons
And she was beside me
Old, she's no, young
Her dark white hair
The white soft skin

Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look!
Shes coming in here
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down
The cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain

Once I had, a little game
I liked to crawl, back in my brain
I think you know, the game I mean
I mean the game, called 'go insane'

You should try, this little game
Just close your eyes, forget your name
Forget the world, forget the people
And we'll erect, a different steeple

This little game, is fun to do
Just close your eyes, no way to lose
And I'm right there, I'm going too
Release control, we're breaking thru

Way back deep into the brain
Back where there's never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of
Gentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils, caves, cool air heights

Each house repeats a mold
Windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant
Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters, smug
With semen eyes in their nipples

Wait
There's been a slaughter here

(Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town
We're going on the run
And you're the one I want to come)

Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run
Lets run

House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run

Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside

Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
C'mon along, we're not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar

Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run

Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl! We're almost home

We should see the gates by mornin'
We should be inside by evening

Sun sun sun
Burn burn burn
MOON, MOON, MOON
I will get you
Soon
Soon
Soon

I am the lizard king
I can do anything

We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls

We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade

For seven years, I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games with the girls of the island
Now, i have come again
To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt?
Now night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be ready'
###All Along The Watchtower###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
"There must be some kind of way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word"
Hey

[Verse 2]
"No reason to get excited"
The thief, he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"
Hey

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl
Hey

[Outro]
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower
###Purple Haze###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things just don't seem the same
Acting funny, but I don't know why
Excuse me while I kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow, or just the end of time?

[Outro]
No, help me
No, yeah purple haze
Oh no, no
Oh help me
Tell me, tell me
Can't go on like this
You make me blow my mind
No, no, no
No, no, purple haze
###Bold As Love###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
Anger he smiles towering in shiny metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on

[Chorus]
But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

[Verse 2]
My red is so confident that he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

[Chorus]
But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Just ask the axis
But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Just ask the axis
###Hey Joe###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey Joe
Where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe
I said, where you going with that gun in your hand?

[Verse 2]
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
And that ain't too cool

[Verse 3]
Hey Joe
I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down, now
Hey Joe
I heard you shot your old lady down
You shot her down to the ground
Yeah

[Verse 4]
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught her messing around, messing around town
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught my old lady messing around town
And I gave her the gun
I shot her!

[Guitar Solo/Bridge]
Hey Joe, alright
Shoot her one more time, baby

[Verse 5]
Hey Joe, said now
Where you going to run to now?
Where you going to run to?
Hey Joe, I said
Where you going to run to now?
Where you, where you going to go?
Well, dig it

[Verse 6]
I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way
Alright
I'm going way down south
Way down where I can be free
There's no one going to find me

[Verse 7]
There's no hangman going to
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now
I got to go now

[Outro]
Hey Joe
You better run on down
Goodbye everybody, ow!
Hey Joe, uh
Run on down
###Voodoo Child (Slight Return)###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island
Might even raise a little sand
Yeah

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby

[Verse 2]
I want to say one more last thing
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to ya one of these days, hahah
I said, I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days, oh yeah
If I don't meet you no more in this world
Then I'll meet you in the next one
And don't be late
Don't be late

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo child, voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby

[Outro]
I'm a voodoo child, baby
I don't take no for an answer
Question no
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby
###The Wind Cries Mary###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

[Hook]
And the wind whispers Mary

[Verse 2]
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife

[Hook]
And the wind it cries Mary

[Verse 3]
The traffic lights they turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
Cause the life they lived is dead

[Hook]
And the wind screams Mary

[Verse 4]
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past?
And with its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers no, this will be the last

[Hook]
And the wind cries Mary
###Manic Depression###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
Manic depression is touching my soul
I know what I want, but I just don't know
How to, go about getting it
Feeling, sweet feeling
Drops from my fingers, fingers
Manic depression is capturing my soul

[Verse 2]
Woman so weary, the sweet cause in vain
You make love, you break love
It's all the same
When it's, when it's over, mama

[Chorus]
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, caress, caress
Manic depression is a frustrating mess

[Verse 3]
Well, I think I'll go turn myself off and go on down
All the way down
Really ain't no use in me hanging around
In your kind of scene

[Chorus]
Music, sweet music
I wish I could caress, and kiss, kiss
Manic depression is a frustrating mess
###Foxy Lady###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Intro]
Foxy
Foxy

[Verse 1]
You know you're a cute little heartbreaker
Foxy
You know you're a sweet little lovemaker
Foxy

[Chorus]
I want to take you home
I won't do you no harm, no
You've got to be all mine, all mine
Ooh, foxy lady

###Fire###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Intro]
Alright
Now dig this, baby

[Verse 1]
You don't care for me
I don't care about that
You got a new fool, ha!
I like it like that

[Pre-Chorus]
I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire

[Chorus]
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire

[Chorus]
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Let me stand next to your fire

###Red House###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
(Ah yeah!)

[Verse 1]
There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby
In ninety nine and one half days

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
The key won't unlock this door
Wait a minute, something's wrong
Lord have mercy, this key won't unlock this door
Somethings goin' on here
I have a bad, bad feeling
That my baby don't live here no more
(That's alright I still got my guitar, look out now!)

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Well I might as well go on over yonder
Way back up on the hill
(I got something to do)
Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
Cause if my baby doesn't love me no more
I know her sister will!
###1983... (A Merman I Should Turn To Be)###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1: Jimi Hendrix]
Hurrah! I awake from yesterday
Alive but the war is here to stay
So, my love, Catherina and me
Decide to take our last walk
Through the noise to the sea
Not to die but to be re-born
Away from a life so battered and torn
Forever

[Verse 2: Jimi Hendrix]
Oh, say can you see, it's really such a mess
Every inch of earth is a fighting nest
Giant pencil and lip-stick tube shaped things
Continue to rain and cause screaming pain
And the arctic stains
From silver blue to bloody red
As our feet find the sand and the sea
Is straight ahead, straight ahead

[Verse 3: Jimi Hendrix]
Well it's too bad that our friends can't be with us today
Well that's too bad
"The machine that we built would never save us"
That's what they say
(That's why they aren't coming with us today)
And they also said
"It's impossible for man to live and breathe underwater forever"
Was their main complaint
(Yeah)
And they also threw this in my face, they said:
"Anyway, you know good well
It would be beyond the will of God
And the grace of the King"
(grace of the King yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4: Jimi Hendrix]
So my darling and I make love in the sand
To salute the last moment ever on dry land
Our machine has done its work, played its part well
Without a scratch on our bodies and we bid it farewell
Starfish and giant foams greet us with a smile
Before our heads go under, we take a last look
At the killing noise of the out of style
The out of style, out of style

[Guitar Mini-Solo]
[Psychedelic Breakdown]

[Verse 5: Jimi Hendrix]
So down and down and down and down
And down and down we go
Hurry, my darling, we mustn't be late for the show
Neptune champion games to an aqua world is so very dear
Right this way smiles a mermaid
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer
Atlantis full of cheer
I can hear Atlantis full of cheer

[Guitar Solo]
###Are You Experienced?###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
If you can just get your mind together
Then come on across to me
We'll hold hands, and then we'll watch the sunrise
From the bottom of the sea

[Chorus]
But first, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have

[Verse 2]
I know, I know you probably scream and cry
That your little world won't let you go
But who in your measly little world
Are you trying to prove that
You're made out of gold and, eh, can't be sold

[Chorus]
So uh, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have

[Verse 3]
Let me prove to you
Trumpets and violins I can hear in distance
I think they're calling our names
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will (haha)
If you just take hold of my hand

[Chorus]
Oh, but are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful
###Voodoo Chile###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a voodoo chile
Lord, I'm a voodoo chile
Well, the night I was born
Lord, I swear the moon turned a fire red
The night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
Well my poor mother cried out "Lord, the gypsy was right!"
And I've seen her, fell down right dead
(Have mercy)

Well, mountain lions found me there waitin'
And set me on a eagles back
Well, mountain lions found me there
And set me on a eagles wing
(It's the eagles wing, baby, what did I say)
He took me past to the outskirts of infinity
And when he brought me back
He gave me a Venus witch's ring
Hey, and he said "Fly on, fly on"

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo chile, yeah, voodoo chile
Hey!

[Verse 2]
Well, I make love to you
And Lord knows you'll feel no pain
Say, I make love to you in your sleep
And Lord knows you felt no pain
(Have mercy)
Because I'm a million miles away
And at the same time I'm right here in your picture frame
(Yeah! What did I say now?)

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo chile, yeah, voodoo chile
Hey!

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Well my arrows are made of desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulphur mines
Say my arrows are made of desire, desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulphur mines
(Way down by the Methane Sea, yeah)
I have a humming bird and it hums so loud
You think you were losing your mind, hmmm

Well I float in liquid gardens
And Arizona new red sand
(Yeah)
I float in liquid gardens
Way down in Arizona red sand
Well, I taste the honey from a flower named Blue
Way down in California
And the in New York drowns as we hold hands

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo chile, yeah, voodoo chile
Hey!

[Drum solo]

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo chile, yeah, voodoo chile
Hey!

[Outro]
###Crosstown Traffic###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
You jump in front of my car when you
You know all the time that
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a ride

[Chorus]
You're just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you
Crosstown traffic
I don't need to run over you
Crosstown traffic
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town

[Verse 2]
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can see you had your fun
But darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

[Chorus]
You're just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you
Crosstown traffic
I don't need to run over you
Crosstown traffic
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town
###May This Be Love###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
Waterfall
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall

[Verse 2]
I can see
My rainbow calling me
Through the misty breeze
Of my waterfall

[Bridge]
Some people say
Daydreaming's for all the, huh
Lazy minded fools
With nothing else to do
So let them laugh, laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
To see me through
I have nothing to lose
Long as I have you

[Verse 3]
Waterfall
Don't ever change your ways
Fall with me for a million days
Oh, my waterfall

[Guitar interlude]
###Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland)###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse]
Have you ever been (have you ever been) to Electric Ladyland?
The magic carpet waits for you so don't you be late
Oh, (I want to show you) the different emotions
(I want to run to) the sounds and motions
Electric woman waits for you and me
So it's time we take a ride, we can cast all of your hang-ups over the seaside
While we fly right over the love-filled sea
Look up ahead, I see the loveland, soon you'll understand

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Make love, make love, make love, make love

(I want to show you)
Show you
###Angel###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse 1]
Angel came down from heaven yesterday
She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she is going to come back tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm going to be by your side"

[Verse 2]
Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against the child's sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
"Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand, you are going to be my man
You are going to rise"
And then she took high over yonder

[Chorus]
And I said, "Fly on, my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I'm going to be by your side"

Strange beautiful grass of green
With your majestic silver seas
Your mysterious mountains I wish to see closer
May I land my peeping machine?

With your majestic and superior Catholic hand
Your people I do not understand
So to you I shall put an end
Then you'll never hear surf music again

###Love Or Confusion###The Jimi Hendrix Experience
[Verse]
Is that the stars in the sky, or is it
Rain falling down
Will it burn me if I touch the sun
So big, so round
Would I be truthful, yeah, in
Choosing you as the one for me?
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Chorus][x2]
My mind is so messed up
Going round and round
Must there be all these colours
Without names, without sound, baby?
My heart burns with feeling, but
My mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

[Outro]
Mama, we must get together and find out
Exactly what we're trying to do
Love or confusion?
Confusion
###I Don't Want to Miss a Thing###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

[Chorus]
Don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby
And I don't wanna miss a thing
'Cause even when I dream of you (even when I dream)
The sweetest dream would never do
I'd still miss you, babe
And I don't want to miss a thing

[Verse 2]
Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
And I just want to stay with you
In this moment forever
Forever and ever

[Chorus]
I don't want to close my eyes
I don't want to fall asleep
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

And just stay here in this moment
For all the rest of time
Yeah (yeah)

All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone, it went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way, everybody's got the dues in life to pay, yeah

[Interlude]
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody sins
You got to lose to know how to win

[Verse 2]
Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

###Cryin'###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
There was a time
When I was so broken hearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
Now listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying cause I let you
Do what you do - down on me

[Bridge]
Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same

[Verse 2]
It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm trying to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dying cause I let you
Do what you do - down on me

Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away

[Chorus/Outro]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you

Your love is sweet
I was cryin' when I met you
###Walk This Way###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
Backstroking lover
Always hiding 'neath the covers
'Till I talked to my daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothing
'Til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changing your ways."
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
All the times I could reminisce
Cause the best things of loving
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this

[Pre-Chorus]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing hey diddle-diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling
Cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay
When she told me to

[Chorus]
"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Ah, just give me a kiss
Like this

[Verse 2]
School girl sweetie
With the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbing way up her knee
There was three young ladies
In the school gym locker
When I noticed they was looking at me
I was a high school loser
Never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me something I missed
Then my next door neighbor
With a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this

[Pre-Chorus]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With your feet flying up in the air
Singing hey diddle-diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like I didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling
Cause she knew what she was doing
When she taught me how to walk this way
She told me to

[Chorus]
"Walk this way, talk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, walk this way"
"Walk this way, talk this way"
Just give me a kiss
Like this
###Crazy###Aerosmith
[Intro: Steven Tyler]
Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

[Verse One: Aerosmith]
Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train and that you're headin'
Out to Hollywood
Girl you been givin' me that line so many times it kinda gets like
Feelin' bad looks good

[Bridge: Aerosmith]
That kinda loving
Turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving
Sends a man right to his grave

[Chorus: Aerosmith]
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

[Verse Two: Aerosmith]
You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough and trying
To tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

[Bridge: Aerosmith]
That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull
Down the shade, yeah
That kind of loving
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same

[Chorus: Aerosmith]
I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on

###Amazing###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die

[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you, finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

[Bridge]
That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

[Verse 2]
You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you, finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

Desperate hearts, desperate hearts....

[Solo]

[Outro: Spoken]
"So from all of us at Aerosmith to all of you out there, wherever you are, remember: the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night."
###Sweet Emotion###Aerosmith
[Intro]

[Chorus]
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

[Verse 1]
Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I got to make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year

[Instrumental Break]

Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire

[Chorus]
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion

[Verse 3]
I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you're sure to understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand

[Instrumental Outro]

Her whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun

Her dog day's just begun (Made you scream at night?)
Now everybody is on the run
Janie's got a gun
###Dude (Looks Like a Lady)###Aerosmith
[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Verse 1]
Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
Backstage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away!

[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Verse 2]
Never judge a book by its cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover?
Sayin' love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus
Lord, imagine my surprise

[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Bridge]
So baby, let me follow you down (Let me take a peek, dear)
Baby, let me follow you down (Do me, do me, do me all night)
Baby, let me follow you down (Turn the other cheek, dear)
Baby, let me follow you down (Do me, do me, do me, do me)

[Bridge]
Ooh, what a funky lady
Oo, she like it, like it, like it, like that
Ooh, he was a lady! Yeah!

[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Outro]
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
Dude, dude, dude, dude looks like a lady
That, that...

I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears, and the cryin' that I do is for you

I want your love - let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough - I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

Don't know what I'm going to do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true - loneliness took me for a ride

Without your love - I'm nothing but a begger
Without your love - a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

Come and save me tonight [x5]

###Jaded###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
Hey, j-j-jaded, you got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be
You're getting it all over me, ex-rated

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I been thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you

And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinking of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm so jaded
And baby, I'm afraid of you

But it's so overrated
Love and hated
Wouldn't trade it
Love me jaded

[Instrumental Break]

Hey, j-j-jaded
There ain't no baby, please
When I'm shooting the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer

###Livin' on the Edge###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
There's something wrong with the world today
I don't know what it is
Something's wrong with our eyes
We're seeing things in a different way
And God knows it ain't his
It sure ain't no surprise

[Chorus]
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge

[Verse 2]
There's something wrong with the world today
The light bulb's getting dim
There's meltdown in the sky
If you can judge a wise man
By the color of his skin
Then mister you're a better man than I

[Chorus]
Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all)
Living on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling)
Living on the edge

[Verse 3]
Tell me what you think about your sit-u-a-tion
Complication - aggravation
Is getting to you
If chicken little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it wasn't, would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again and again
Tell me what you think about your sit-u-a-tion
Complication - aggravation
Is getting to you
If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling
Even if it was would you still come crawling
Back again?
I bet you would my friend
Again and again and again and again

[Bridge]
Something right with the world today
And everybody knows it's wrong
But we can tell 'em no or we could let it go
But I'd would rather be a hanging on

Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself from falling)
Living on the edge
(You can't help yourself at all)
Living on the edge
(You can't stop yourself from falling)
Living on the edge

Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Living on the edge
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Living on the edge
You can't help yourself [x2]
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself [x2]
Living on the edge
You can't help yourself from falling

###What It Takes###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
There goes my old girlfriend, there's another diamond ring
And all those late night promises? I guess they don't mean a thing
So baby, what's the story? Did you find another man
Is it easy to sleep in the bed that we made
When you don't look back I guess the feelings start to fade away
I used to feel your fire, but now it's cold inside
And you're back on the street like you didn't miss a beat, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Girl, before I met you I was F.I.N.E, fine
But your love made me a prisoner, yeah, my heart's been doing time
You spent me up like money, then you hung me out to dry
It was easy to keep all your lies in disguise
Cause you had me in deep with the devil in your eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice
Tell me what it takes to let you go of the good times

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're happy that you're on your own, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me that it's better when you're all alone
Tell me that your body doesn't miss my touch
Tell me that my loving didn't mean that much
Tell me you aren't dying when you're crying for me

[Chorus]
Tell me what it takes to let you go (Ooh)
Tell me how the pain's supposed to go (Oh yeah)
Tell me how it is that you can sleep in the night
Without thinking you lost everything that was
Good in your life to the toss of the dice

[Outro]
Tell me who's to blame for thinking twice
No, no, no, no, 'cause I don't want to burn in paradise
Ooo
Let go, let go, let go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
I don't want to burn, I don't want to burn
###Big Ten Inch Record###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
Got me the strangest woman
Believe me this trick's no cinch
But I really get her going
When I whip out my big 10 inch

[Chorus]
Record of a band that plays the blues
Well a band that plays the blues
She just love my big 10 inch

She just love my big 10 inch

She just love my big 10 inch
Record of her favorite blues

Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side)
Oh take me to the other side (take me to the other side)

[Verse 1]
My mamma told me there'd be days like this
And man, she wasn't foolin
Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
Uh uh-huh

You said you'd never leave me
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
You're crying me a river but I got to get across

[Chorus]
Lovin' you has go to be (take me to the other side)

You loved me, you hate me, you cut me down to size
You blinded me with love and yeah it opened up my eyes

[Chorus]
Lovin' you has go to be (take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side)

Take me to the other side
I'm looking for another kind of love
Oh Lordy, how I need it

You loved me, you hate me, I used to be your lover
You know you had it coming girl so take me to the other

[Chorus]
Lovin' you has go to be (take me to the other side)
Like the devil and the deep blue sea (take me to the other side)
Forget about your foolish pride (take me to the other side)
Oh take me to the other side (take me to the other side)
###Fly Away from Here###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
We gotta find a way
Yeah, I can't wait another day
Ain't nothing gonna change
If we stay around here
Gotta do what it takes
Goes on in our hands
We all make mistakes
Yeah, but it's never too late to start again
Take another breath and say another prayer

[Chorus]
And then fly away from here
Anywhere, yeah, I don't care
We just fly away from here
Our hopes and dreams are out there somewhere
Won't let time pass us by
We'll just fly, yeah

If this life?
It seems harder now
It ain't no never mind
You got me by your side

Won't let time pass us by

###Hole in My Soul###Aerosmith
[Verse 1]
I'm down a one way street
With a one night stand
With a one track mind
Out in no man's land
The punishment sometimes
Don't seem to fit the crime
Yeah, there's a hole in my soul
But one thing I learned
For every love letter written
Is another one burned
So you tell me how it's gonna be this time

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it over?
Is it over?
'Cause I'm blowing out the flame

[Chorus]
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find there's nothing there, girl
Yeah, I swear, I'm telling you girl, yeah 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, yeah I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose

[Verse 2]
I'm as dry as a seven-year drought
I got dust for tears
And I'm all tapped out
Sometimes I feel broke, can't get fixed
I know there's been all kinds of shoes
Underneath your bed
Now I sleep with my boots on
But you're still in my head
And something tells me this time
I'm down to my last licks

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if it's over
Then it's over
And it's driving me insane

[Chorus]
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find there's nothing there
Girl, yeah, I swear, I'm telling you, girl, yeah 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, yeah, I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, is it over?
Yeah, it's over
And I'm blowing out the flame

[Chorus]
Take a walk outside your mind
Tell me how it feels to be
The one who turns the knife inside of me
Take a look and you will find there's nothing there, girl
Yeah, I swear, I'm telling you, girl, yeah 'cause
There's a hole in my soul that's been killing me forever
It's a place where a garden never grows
There's a hole in my soul, yeah I should have known better
'Cause your love's like a thorn without a rose
Yeah, yeah
###Dreams###Fleetwood Mac
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know

Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know
You will know, you'll know
###The Chain###Fleetwood Mac
[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Verse 2]
Listen to the wind blow, down comes the night
Running in the shadows, damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence, damn the dark, damn the light

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying you would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
Chains keep us together (run into the shadows)
###Landslide###Fleetwood Mac
[Verse 1]
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Till the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Hmmmm

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
I'm getting older too

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older too
Oh, I'm getting older too

[Verse 2 / Outro]
I took my love, I took it down
Oh if you climb a mountain and turned around
And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well the landslide will bring you down
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well the landslide will bring you down
Oh, the landslide will bring it down
###Silver Springs###Fleetwood Mac
[Verse 1]
You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't say that she's pretty?
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Verse 2]
So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't say that she's pretty?
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Chorus]
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

[Outro]
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman who loves you
Was I just a fool

I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
(Give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman who loves you
(Was I just a fool)

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
###Rhiannon###Fleetwood Mac
[Verse 1]
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

[Verse 2]
She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

[Refrain]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

[Verse 3]
She rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

[Chorus]
All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?
Will you ever win?

[Refrain]
Rhiannon
Rhiannon
Rhiannon

[Outro]
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Taken by, taken by the sky
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
Dreams unwind
Love's a state of mind
###Go Your Own Way###Fleetwood Mac
[Verse 1 - Fleetwood Mac]
Loving you isn't the right thing to do
How can I ever change things that I feel?
If I could maybe I'd give you my world
How can I when you won't take it from me?

[Chorus - Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)

[Verse 2 - Fleetwood Mac]
Tell me why everything turned around
Packing up shacking up's all you wanna do
If I could baby I'd give you my world
Open up everything's waiting for you

[Chorus - Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)

[Mini Bridge]

[Chorus - Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)

You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)

[Bridge]

[Chorus - Fleetwood Mac]
You can go your own way (go your own way)
You can call it another lonely day
You can go your own way (go your own way)
###Gypsy###Fleetwood Mac
[Intro]
So I'm back, to the velvet underground
Back to the floor, that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was

[Verse 1]
And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does
And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

[Verse 2]
To the gypsy that remains
Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear, I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

[Bridge]
She is dancing away from me now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And a memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy, oh
You see your gypsy

[Hook]
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you

[Outro]
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
(She was just a wish)
(She was just a wish)
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
###Little Lies###Fleetwood Mac
[Intro]​

[Verse 1: Christine McVie]
If I could turn the page
In time then I'd rearrange
Just a day or two
Close my, close my, close my eyes
But I couldn't find a way
So I'll settle for one day
To believe in you
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Although I'm not making plans
I hope that you understand
There's a reason why
Close your, close your, close your eyes
No more broken hearts
We're better off apart
Let's give it a try
Tell me, tell me, tell me lies

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies
(Tell me lies, tell me, tell me lies)
Oh, no, no you can't disguise
(You can't disguise, no you can't disguise)
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

{​Bridge}​

To believe in you
(Tell me, tell me, tell me lies)

[Chorus: Christine McVie]
Tell me lies
Tell me sweet little lies

It's alright, I know it's right

To you, I'll give the world
To you, I'll never be cold
Cause I feel that when I'm with you
It's alright, I know it's right

Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you, I love you
Like never before

Come round and see me again

If you wake up and don’t want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You’ll see things in a different way

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here
It’ll be better than before
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Why not think about times to come?
And not about the things that you’ve done?
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here
It’ll be better than before
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone

All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don’t believe that it’s true
I never meant any harm to you

Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here
It’ll be better than before
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone

[Chorus: Buckingham and C. McVie]
Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow
Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here
It’ll be better than before
Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone

Ooh don’t you look back
Ooh don’t you look back

Can you hear me calling
Out your name?

Oh ah, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh ah, I want to be with you everywhere

###Gold Dust Woman###Fleetwood Mac
[Verse 1]
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path and I’ll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Verse 2]
Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale
Up for sale

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
Well, is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Chorus: Variation]
Well did she make you cry
Make you break down
Shatter your illusions of love
And now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how to pick up the pieces
And go home? And go home, and go home

[Outro]
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
Ooh, black widow
Ooh, pale shadow, she’s a dragon
Gold dust woman
Woman, woman
###Seven Wonders###Fleetwood Mac
[Verse 1]
So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well you know I'm sorry but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end

All the way back you held out your hand

[Bridge]
If I hope and if I pray
Ooh it might work out someday

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again (I'll never live to see that beauty, that beauty, that same same beauty again)

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the)
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

(Well maybe it might work out someday)

If I live to see the seven wonders (if I live to see the seven wonders)
###Sara###Fleetwood Mac
[Verse 1]
Wait a minute baby
Stay with me awhile
Said you'd give me light
But you never told me 'bout the fire

[Chorus 1]
Drowning in the sea of love
Where everyone would love to drown
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
When you build your house
Then call me home

[Verse 2]
And he was just like a great dark wing
Within the wings of a storm
I think I had met my match
He was singing
And undoing, and undoing
Ooh the laces
Undoing the laces

[Chorus 2]
Said Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, never stop
But now it's gone
It doesn't matter what for
But when you build your house
Oh then call me home

[Verse 3]
Hold on
The night is coming and the starling flew for days
I'd stay home at night all the time
I'd go anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
Ask me and I'm there, yeah
Ask me and I'm there 'cause I care

[Chorus 1]
In the sea of love
Where every woman would love to drown
But now it's gone
They say it doesn't matter anymore
If you build your house
Then please, call me home

[Chorus 2]
Sara, you're the poet in my heart
Never change, and don't you ever stop
And now it's gone
No, it doesn't matter anymore
When you build your house
I'll come by

Sara
All I ever wanted, was to know that you were dreaming, Sara
There’s a heartbeat that never really died
Oh, won't you swallow your pride?
###Tusk###Fleetwood Mac
[Verse]
Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?
Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him who's the latest on his throne?

[Bridge]
Don't say that you love me, hiyee-ha
Just tell me that you want me, hiyee-ha
Tusk!
Just say that you want me, hiyee-ha
Don't say that you

Tusk!
Real savage-like

Tusk!
Tusk!

Let me go down and do my stuff?

Someone who’s going to give you peace of mind
When times go bad
When times go rough
Won’t you lay me down in tall grass

I’m just second-hand news, yeah

Sweet wonderful you
You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so?

I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I’m beginning to wonder why

I never did believe in miracles
But I’ve a feeling it’s time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic

Hanging on to you

Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you

Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"

Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

The sad sack was a sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, "Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair"

[Chorus:]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

[Verse 5:]
Shifty Henry said to Bugs, "For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Well, it's down at the end of lonely street
At Heartbreak Hotel

You make me so lonely baby

And time goes by, so slowly and time can do so much
Are you, still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
Godspeed your love to me

To the waiting arms of the sea

Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love

###Are You Lonesome Tonight?###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

[Verse 2]
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Spoken:
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each of us must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two, you seemed to changed, you acted strange
And why I've never know
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

[Outro]
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?
###Suspicious Minds###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Verse 2]
So, if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?

Here we go again
Asking where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm crying
(Yes, I'm crying)

[Chorus]
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

[Bridge]
Oh let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
When honey, you know I've never lied to you
Mmm yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby

Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?

[Outro]
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby...
###Blue Suede Shoes###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Chorus]
Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Verse 2]
Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name
All over the place

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Bridge]
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruit jar

[Verse 3]
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Chorus]
Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go

But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Verse 2]
Well, you can knock me down
Step in my face
Slander my name
All over the place

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Bridge]
You can burn my house
Steal my car
Drink my liquor
From an old fruitjar

[Verse 3]
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes

[Chorus]
Well, it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Well it's
Blue-Blue Blue suede shoes
Blue-Blue Blue suede shoes-Yeah
Blue-Blue Blue suede shoes-Baby
Blue-Blue Blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
###I Can't Stop Loving You###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
To live in memory
Of such an old lonesome time

[Verse 2]
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

[Verse 3]
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue

[Verse 4]
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
###Don't Be Cruel###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

[Verse 2]
Baby, if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please, let's forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

[Verse 3]
Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you baby, cross my heart

[Verse 4]
Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

[Verse 5]
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of
###In The Ghetto###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

[Verse 2]
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

[Verse 3]
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

[Verse 4]
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

[Verse 5]
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, He steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

[Bridge]
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

[Verse 6]
And as her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto

And his mama cries
In the ghetto
###Stuck On You###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
Shake-a, shake- sugar
But you'll never shake me
Uh-uh-uh
No-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick because I'm
Stuck on you

[Verse 2]
Going to run my fingers thru your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm going to stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you

[Verse 3]
Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall
I am not going to do you no good at all
Because once I catch you and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart

[Verse 4]
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is going to keep us tied
Uh-uh-uh
Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh
I'm gonna stick like glue
Stick, because I'm
Stuck on you
###Burning Love###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
Lord Almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Higher higher
It's burning through to my soul
Girl, girl, girl
You going to set me on fire
My brain is flaming
I don't know which way to go

[Chorus]
Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I feel my temperature rising
Help me, I'm flaming
I must be a hundred and nine
Burning, burning, burning
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine

[Chorus]
Because your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love

[Verse 3]
It's coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Won't you help me
I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe
And my chest is a-heaving
Lord, have mercy
I'm burning a hole where I lay

[Chorus]
Your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love
(Ah, ah, burning love)

[Outro]
I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
###Blue Christmas###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
(Ahh, ahh)
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's when those blue memories start callin'
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

[Bridge]
(Oooooaaaooooh
Oooooaaaooooh)

[Outro]
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
(Ahh, ahh)
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
###Love Me###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1: Jerry Leiber - Mike Stoller]
Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me
Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me

[Verse 2]
If you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only

[Chorus]
I would beg and steal
(Beg and steal)
Just to feel
(Just to feel)
Your heart
(I want your heart)
Beating close to mine
(So close to mine)

[Verse 3]
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
I'll be sad and blue
Crying over you, dear only

[Chorus]
I would beg and steal
(He would beg and steal)
Just to feel
(Yes, just to feel)
Your heart
(I want your heart)
Beating close to mine
(So close to mine)

[Verse 4]
Well, if you ever go
Darling, I'll be oh so lonely
Beggin' on my knees
All I ask is please, please love me
Oh yeah
###My Way###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
And now the end is near
So I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

[Verse 2]
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 3]
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

[Verse 4]
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

[Verse 5]
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

[Verse 6]
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fails, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

[Verse 7]
For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words he would reveal
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
###All Shook Up###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
Uh, well, a-bless my soul
What's wrong with me?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug

[Chorus]
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
Who do you thank when you have such luck?

[Chorus]
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

[Bridge 1]
Well, please don't ask me what's on my mind
I'm a little mixed up, but I feel fine
When I'm near the girl that I love best
My heart beats so it scares me to death!

[Verse 3]
When she touched my hand, what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

[Chorus]
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!

[Bridge 2]
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree
There's only one cure for this body of mine
That's to have that girl that I love so fine!

[Verse 3]
She touched my hand, what a chill I got
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup

[Chorus]
I'm in love
I'm all shook up
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!
I'm all shook up
###An American Trilogy###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1 - Dixie]
Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland
Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
Because Dixieland, that's where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland

[Verse 2 - The Battle Hymn of the Republic]
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on

[Verse 3 - All My Trials]
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
But all my trials, Lord will soon be over


Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on
###Always On My Mind###Elvis Presley
[Verse 1]
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind

[Verse 2]
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I make you feel second best
Girl, I'm so sorry I was blind

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind

[Bridge]
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Outro]
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you...
###Paranoid###Black Sabbath
[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

[Chorus]
Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late
###Iron Man###Black Sabbath
[Intro]
I am Iron Man!

[Verse 1]
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

[Verse 2]
Now, the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

[Chorus]
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now, he has his revenge

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!

[Instrumental Outro]
###War Pigs###Black Sabbath
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields, the bodies burnin'
As the war machine keeps turnin'
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisonin' their brainwashed minds
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that all to the poor, yeah!
Time will tell on their power minds
Makin' war just for fun
Treatin' people just like pawns in chess
Wait 'til their judgment day comes, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Now, in darkness, world stops turnin'
Ashes where their bodies burnin'
No more war pigs have the power
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of Judgment, God is callin'
On their knees, the war pigs crawlin'
Beggin' mercies for their sins
Satan, laughin', spreads his wings
Oh, Lord, yeah!

[Starts "Luke's Wall"]
###N.I.B.###Black Sabbath
[Bass Instrumental: Bassically]

[Verse]
Oh yeah!
Some people say my love cannot be true
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you
I will give you those things you thought unreal
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Follow me now and you will not regret
Leaving the life you led before we met
You are the first to have this love of mine
Forever with me 'til the end of time

[Chorus]
Your love for me has just got to be real
Before you know the way I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel
I'm going to feel

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah!
Now, I have you with me, under my power
Our love grows stronger, now, with every hour
Look into my eyes, you'll see who I am
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand

[Instrumental Outro]
###Changes###Black Sabbath
[Verse 1]
I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend that I ever had
She was my woman, I love her so
But it's too late now, I've let her go

[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2]
We shared the years, we shared each day
In love, together, we found the way
But soon, the world had its evil way
My heart was blinded, love went astray

[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 3]
It took so long to realize
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Now, all my days are filled with tears
Wish I could go back and change these years

[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
###Heaven and Hell###Black Sabbath
[Verse 1]
Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker

[Refrain]
So, it's on and on and on
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well

[Verse 2]
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming

[Refrain]
So, it's on and on and on
Oh, it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on
Heaven and Hell, I can tell
Fool, fool! Oh, yeah-yeah!

[Verse 3]
Well, if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer
But nobody bleeds for the dancer

[Refrain]
And it's on and on, on and on and on...

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Fool, fool!
Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!

[Instrumental Outro]
###Planet Caravan###Black Sabbath
[Verse 1]
We sail...
Through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon...
In silver dreams
Pours down in beams
Light of the night
The earth...
A purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

[Verse 2]
While down...
Below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight
Breaks dawn from night
And so...
We pass on by
The crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel
The universe

[Instrumental Outro]
###Black Sabbath###Black Sabbath
[Music video]

[Intro]

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no!

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no!
###Sabbath Bloody Sabbath###Black Sabbath
[Verse 1]
You've seen life through distorted eyes
You know you have to learn
The execution of your mind
You really had to turn
The race is run, the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don’t want to know

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you’re on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

[Verse 2]
The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
An' there’s just no return
You’re wishing that the hands of doom
Could take your mind away
An' you don’t care if you don’t see
Again the light of day

[Chorus]
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies
You bastards!

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Where can you run to
What more can you do
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to hell
Burned out confusion
Nothing more to tell, yeah

Everything around you
What’s it coming to
God knows as your dog nose
Bog blast all of you
Sabbath, bloody sabbath
Nothing more to do
Living just for dying
Dying just for you, yeah

###Sweet Child O’ Mine###Guns N’ Roses
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh
As the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh! Sweet child of mine
Oh, oh, oh-oh! Sweet love of mine

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain
To quietly pass me by

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh! Sweet child of mine
Uh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh yeah! oh, oh! Sweet child of mine
Uh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine
Uh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet child of mine
Uh-oh, oh, oh! Sweet love of mine

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Uh, where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Sweet child...
Where do we go now?
Ay, ay, ay ay, ay...
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Sweet child
Sweet child o' mine
###November Rain###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah...

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing lasts forever
An' we both know hearts can change
An' it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain
But lovers always come and lovers always go
An' no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
Walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine
All mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walking
In the cold November rain

[Refrain]
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time, all alone?
Uh, everybody needs some time on their own
Uh, don't you know you need some time, all alone?

[Bridge]
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Refrain]
Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time, all alone
Uh, everybody needs some time on their own
Uh, don't you know you need some time, all alone?

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Verse 3]
An' when your fears subside
An' shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

[Chorus]
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

[Guitar Solo 3]

[Outro]
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one!
You're not the only one!
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one!
You're not the only one!
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one!
You're not the only one!
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
###Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

[Chorus]
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knocking on heaven's door

###Welcome to the Jungle###Guns N’ Roses
[Intro]
Oh my god...
Jump!

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
Ohhh ah, I wanna watch you bleed

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it you're going to bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Ohhh ah, I wanna hear you scream

[Verse 3]
Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
Uh oh, I wanna watch you bleed

And when you're high, you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down, yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
You know where you are?
You're in the jungle, baby
You're gonna die

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your, it's going to bring you down, huh
###Don’t Cry###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
Talk to me softly
There's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow
And please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've
I've been there before
Something is changing inside you
And don't you know?

[Chorus]
Don't you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, babe
And don't you cry tonight

[Verse 2]
Give me a whisper
And give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you
Tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you
And the times we had, babe

[Chorus]
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, babe
And don't you cry tonight

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And please remember
That I never lied
And please remember
How I felt inside now, honey
You got to make it your own way
But you'll be alright now, sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow
Come the morning light now, babe

[Chorus]
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, babe
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry

Don't you cry tonight
###Civil War###Guns N’ Roses
"What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So, you get what we had here, last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
And I don't like it any more than you men"

[Intro]
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of god and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

[Bridge 1]
D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said peace could last forever?
And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

[Chorus]
And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
(Ain't that fresh?)
I don't need your civil war

[Intro Reprise]
Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before

Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more

[Verse 2]
My hands are tied
For, all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on, as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
And all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

[Bridge 2]
We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

[Chorus]
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
(Ain't that fresh?)
I don't need your civil war

[Outro]
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
(Ain't that fresh?)
I don't need your civil war

I don't need one more war
I don't need one more war

What's so civil about war anyway?
###Paradise City###Guns N’ Roses
[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?

[Verse 1]
Just an urchin living under the street, I'm a
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line!
Rags and riches, or so they say, you gotta
Keep pushing for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble, when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doing the time!

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

[Verse 2]
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The Surgeon General say's it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette
But I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe!

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, oh yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
So far–away
So far–away
So far–away
So far–away

[Verse 3]
Captain America's been torn apart, now
He's a court jester with a broken heart
He said, "turn me around and take me back to the start
I must be losing my mind
Are you blind?
I've seen it all a million times!

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, oh yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, home

[Outro]
I wanna go, I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see, how good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down (oh yeah), spin me 'round
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see, how good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see, how good it can be
Oh, take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna go, I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Baby
###Patience###Guns N’ Roses
[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Axl Rose whistling]

[Verse 1]
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you, I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think 'bout you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure, but you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow
And it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow
And we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience, hm yeah...

[Verse 2]
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense, but I can't speed up the time
But you know love there's one more thing to consider

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow
And things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time
'Cause the lights are shinin' bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, I'll never break it, 'cause I can't take it

[Acoustic Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Little patience, hm yeah, hm yeah
Need a little patience, yeah
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience
(I've been walkin' the streets at night), yeah
(Just tryin' to get it right)
A little patience
(It's hard to see with so many around), yeah
(You know I don't like bein' stuck in the crowd)
Could use some patience
(And the streets don't change, but maybe the names), yeah
(I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you)
Gotta have more patience
(Yeah-yeah, but I need you), yeah
(Oh, I need you) All it takes is patience
Just a little patience (oh, I need you)
Is all you need (oh, this time)
###One in a Million###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
Guess I needed
Some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind
Some peace of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it
Down to 6th in L.A
Maybe a Greyhound
Could be my way

Police and niggers
That's right
Get out of my way
Don't need to buy none of your
Gold chains today
Now don't need no bracelets
Clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket
'Til then, won't you cut me some slack

[Chorus 1]
You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high

[Verse 2]
Immigrants and faggots
They make no sense to me
They come to our country
And think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini Iran
Or spread some fucking disease
They talk so many God damn ways
It's all Greek to me
Well some say I'm lazy
And others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy
I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time
Since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to and end, I
I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

[Chorus 2]
You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe some day we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high

[Verse 3]
Radicals and racists
Don't point your finger at me
I'm a small town white boy
Just trying to make ends meet
Don't need your religion
Don't watch that much TV
Just making my living, baby
Well, that's enough for me

[Chorus 1]
You're one in a million
Yeah that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe
You're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you
Before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you
But you were much too high
Much too high
Much too high
Much too high
###Mr. Brownstone###Guns N’ Roses
[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
I get up around seven
Get out of bed around nine
And I don't worry about nothing, no
Because worrying's a waste of my–time
The show usually starts around seven
We go on stage around nine
Get on the bus about eleven
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mr Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone!
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

[Bridge]
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep trying to get a little better
Said the little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep trying to get a little better
Said the little better than before

[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mr Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone!
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now, I get up around whenever
I used to get up on time
But that old man he's a real motherfucker
Gonna kick him on down the line

[Bridge]
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep trying to get a little better
Said the little better than before
I used to do a little but a little wouldn't do it
So the little got more and more
I just keep trying to get a little better
Said the little better than before

[Chorus]
We've been dancing with Mr Brownstone
He's been knocking, he won't leave me alone
No, no, no, he won't leave me alone
Oh, leave me alone

[Outro]
Stuck it in the middle and I shot it in the middle
And it, it drove outta my mind
I should've known better, said I wish I never met her
Said I leave it all–behind
Yowsa!
###Rocket Queen###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
If I say I don't need anyone
I can say these things to you
'Cause I can turn on anyone
Just like I've turned on you
I've got a tongue like a razor
A sweet switchblade knife
And I can do you favors
But then you'll do whatever I like

[Chorus]
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene

[Verse 2]
I've seen everything imaginable
Pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible
Honey, you'd be surprised
I'm a sexual innuendo
In this burned out paradise
If you turn me on to anything
You better turn me on tonight

[Chorus]
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene

[Interlude/Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen
I might be a little young, but, honey, I ain't naive
Here I am, and you're a Rocket Queen, oh yeah
I might be too much, but, honey, you're a bit obscene

[Bridge]
I see you standin'
Standin' on your own
It's such a lonely place for you
For you to be
If you need a shoulder
Or if you need a friend
I'll be here standing
Until the bitter end
No one needs the sorrow
No one needs the pain
I hate to see you
Walking out there
Out in the rain
So, don't chastise me
Or think I - I mean you harm
Of those that take you
Leave you strung out
Much too far
Baby, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Don't ever leave me
Say you'll always be there
All I ever wanted
Was for you
To know that I care
###Nightrain###Guns N’ Roses
[Pre-Chorus]
Loaded like a freight train
Flying like an aeroplane
Feeling like a space brain
One more time tonight

[Verse]
Well, I'm a west coast struttin
One bad motherfucker got a rattlesnake suitcase under my arm
Said, I'm a mean machine, been drinkin' gasoline
And, honey, you can make my motor hum
Well, I got one chance left in a nine lives cat
I got a dog eat dog sly smile
I got a Molotov cocktail with a match, to-go
I smoke my cigarette with style
And I can tell you, honey, you can make my money tonight
Wake up late
Honey, put on your clothes
An' take your credit card to the liquor store
An' that's one for you, and two for me
By tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be loaded like a freight train
Flying like an aeroplane
Feeling like a space brain
One more time tonight

[Chorus]
I'm on the nightrain
Bottoms up
I'm on the nightrain
Fill my cup
I'm on the nightrain
Ready to crash and burn
I never learn
I'm on the nightrain
I love that stuff
I'm on the nightrain
An' I can never get enough
I'm on the nightrain
Never to return, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Loaded like a freight train
Flying like an aeroplane
Speeding like a space brain
One more time tonight

[Chorus]
I'm on the nightrain
An' I'm looking for some
I'm on the nightrain
So I can leave this slum
I'm on the nightrain
An' I'm ready to crash and burn
Nightrain
Bottoms up
I'm on the nightrain
Fill my cup
I'm on the nightrain
Ah, ah, ah, whoa yeah
I'm on the nightrain
Love that stuff
I'm on the nightrain
An' I can never get enough
Ridin' the nightrain
I guess I
I guess, I guess, I guess
I never learn
On the nightrain
Float me home
Oh I'm on the nightrain
Ridin' the nightrain
Never to return
Nightrain
###Estranged###Guns N’ Roses
[Pre-Chorus]
When you're talkin' to yourself
And nobody's home
You can fool yourself
You came in this world alone
Alone...

[Chorus]
So nobody ever told you, babe
How it was gonna be?
So what'll happen to you, babe?
Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two

[Verse 1]
Old at heart, but I'm only 28
And I'm much too young to let love break my heart
Young at heart, but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apart

[Bridge]
I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
And what more could you ask from me?
How could you say that I never needed you?
When you took everything
Said, you took everything from me

[Verse 2]
Young at heart, an' it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

[Pre-Chorus]
Still talking to myself
And nobody's home
Alone...

[Chorus]
So nobody ever told us, babe
How it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us, babe?
Guess we'll have to wait and see

[Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way–find another day
With all the changing seasons–of my life
Maybe I'll get it right next time
An' now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
Back down on the ground
You don't talk so loud
An' you don't walk so proud–anymore
And what for?

[Solo 2]

[Verse 4]
Well I jumped into the river
Too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own
An' drifting all alone
If it doesn't show, give it time
To read between the lines
'Cause I see the storm is getting closer
And the waves, they get so high
Seems everything we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?

[Solo 3]

[Outro]
I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through–this time
Woah, this time
Without you
I knew the storm was getting closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everything we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die
###You Could Be Mine###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn
And I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lying on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake
It's nothing new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie, too

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine

[Verse 2]
Now, holidays come, and then they go
It's nothing new, today
Collect another memory
When I come home, late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars I'm home again

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine

You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine, mine, mine ,mine

[Bridge]
You've gone sketching too many times
Why don't you give it a rest?
Why must you find another reason to cry?

[Solo]

[Bridge 2]
Well, you're breaking down my back and I've been racking out my brain
It don't matter how we make it, 'cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage, but your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it until morning, but this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
An' you can take the pity so far, but it's more than I can stand
Cause this couch-trip's getting older
Tell me how long has it been?
'Cause 5 years is forever, and you haven't grown up yet

[Chorus]
You could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine
You should be
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
Yeah
###It's So Easy###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
I see your sister in her Sunday dress
She's out to please, she pouts her best
She's out to take, no need to try
She's ready to make

[Chorus]
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, babe
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

[Verse 2]
Cars are crashing every night
I drink and drive everything's in sight
I make the fire, but I miss the firefight
I hit the bullseye every night

[Chorus]
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, babe
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

[Post-Chorus]
It's so easy
But nothing seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the night

[Bridge]
See me hit you
You fall down
I see you standing there
You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
Fuck off

[Verse 3]
You get nothing for nothing if that's what ya do
Turn around, bitch, I got a use for you
Besides, you ain't got nothing better to do
And I'm bored

[Chorus]
It's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me, babe
Yeah, it's so easy, easy
When everybody's trying to please me

[Post-Chorus]
It's so easy
But nothing seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade into the nigh

[Bridge]
So come with me
Don't ask me where 'cause I don't know
I try to please you
I ain't got no money, but it goes to show

[Outro]
It's so easy, so fucking easy
It's so easy, so damn easy
It's so easy, oh, so fucking easy
It's so easy, yeah, so easy
It's so easy, so fucking easy
It's so easy, yeah!
###Don't Cry (Alt. Lyrics)###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
If we could see tomorrow, what of your plans?
No one can live in sorrow, ask all your friends
Times that you took in stride, they're back in demand
I was the one who was washing blood off your hands

[Chorus]
Don't you cry tonight
I still love you, baby
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
And don't you cry tonight

[Verse 2]
I know the things you wanted, they're not what you have
With all the people talking, it's driving you mad
If I was standing by you, how would you feel
Knowing your love's decided, and all love is real?

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I thought I could live in your world
As years all went by, with all the voices I've heard
Something has died
And when you're in need of someone, my heart won't deny you
So many seem so lonely with no one left to cry to, baby

[Chorus] (x2)
###My Michelle###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
Your daddy works in porno, now that mommy's not around
She used to love her heroin, but now she's underground
So, you stay out late at night and you do your coke for free
Drivin' your friends crazy with your life's insanity

[Chorus]
Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Look out

[Verse 2]
Sowin all your wild oats in another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday, maybe Thursday you can sleep
But school starts much too early and this hotel wasn't free
So party till your connection call, honey, I'll return the key

[Chorus]
Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Well, well, well, you never can tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle

[Bridge]
Everyone needs love
You know that it's true
Someday you'll find someone that'll fall in love with you
But, oh, the time it takes
When you're all alone
Someday you'll find someone that you can call your own
But 'til then ya better!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Now you're clean and so discreet I won't say a word
But most of all this song is true, case you haven't heard
So c'mon and stop your cryin', 'cause we both know money burns
Honey don't stop tryin' an' you'll get what you deserve

[Chorus]
Well, well, well, you just can't tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle
Well, well, well, you never can tell
Well, well, well, my Michelle

[Outro]
My my my Michelle
My my my Michelle
My my my Michelle
Michelle
###This I Love###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
And now, I don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
But then, it seems that I had seen it in her eyes
Though it might not be wise, I'd still have to try
With all the love I have inside, I can't deny
I just can't let it die, 'cause her heart's just like mine
And she holds her pain inside
So, if you ask me why she wouldn't say goodbye
I know somewhere inside
There is a special light still shining bright
And even on the darkest night, she can't deny

[Chorus]
So, if she's somewhere near me, I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me, please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

[Verse 2]
No matter how I try, you say it's all a lie
So what's the use of my confessions to a crime
Of passions that won't die, in my heart?

[Chorus]
So, if she's somewhere near me, I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me, please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
So, if she's somewhere near me, I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever make me feel I'm so alive
I hoped she'd never leave me, please God, you must believe me
I've searched the universe and found myself within her eyes

[Outro]
So, now I don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye
It just might be that I had seen it in her eyes
And now, it seems that I gave up my ghost of pride
I'll never say goodbye
###Since I Don't Have You###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse]
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
And I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
Happiness and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And she's been here since then

[Bridge]
Yeah, we're fucked!
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

[Outro]
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh, oh!
You, you, you, oh yeah!
###Coma###Guns N’ Roses
[Verse 1]
Hey, you caught me in a coma
And I don't think I wanna ever come back to this world again
Kinda like it in a coma
'Cause no one's ever gonna

Oh, make me come back to this world again

Now, I feel as if I'm floating away
I can't feel all the pressure, and I like it this way
But my body's calling
My body's calling:

"Won't you come back to this world again?"

Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end, I've got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing
I've gone sailing

I could leave so easily
My friends are calling back to me
I said, they're
They're leavin' it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is going on
Goddamn it

[Bridge]
Slipping farther and farther away
It's a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit

Help me
"Okay, let's get this guy in the program please, we're losing him." "Start an IV Please."
Help Me
"Come on... His airways.. someone's got to protect his airways. I want two..."
"Where's the defibrillator?"
"Two IV's over here please. That's two more now. We're losing him"
"Let's go"
Help Me
"Slow motion here. This guy's going..."
Bastard
"Let's get him in ER"
"...Going out on us"
"Who's got the defibrillator?"

[Bridge 2]
Please understand me

[Verse 2]
I'm climbing through the wreckage of all my twisted dreams
But this cheap investigation just can't stifle all my screams
And I'm waiting at the crossroads, waiting for you
Waiting for you
Where are you?

[Breakdown]
No one's going to bother me anymore
No one's going to mess with my head no more
I can't understand what all the fightin's for
But it's so nice here, down off the shore
I wish you could see this, 'cause there's nothing to see
It's peaceful here and it's fine with me
Not like the world where I used to live
I never really wanted to live


I know
"Okay, we're starting to lose this guy. I want that IV and his airway protected!"
"Let's get some people in here!"
"Get the crash cart please, we're losing this guy. He's going..." "Give me an airway please"
"... Going under."
"Clear"
Zap him again
"How about an IV, stat?"
"Okay... you better protect the airway, you're starting to lose him." "clear!"
Zap the son of a bitch again

"Listen to me"
"Axl, are you listening to me?"
"Don't walk away from me!"
'You are such a fucking prick, I am so pissed with you"
"Get back over here!"
"All I hear is bullshit, all the time"
"All you ever wanna do is have sex, sex sex"
"I just don't give a shit anymore"

"I love you"

[Verse 3]
You live your life like it's a coma
Won't you tell me why we'd wanna?
With all the reasons you give, it's
It's kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that I've seen
Any reason why you should stay?
Maybe we'd be better off without you, anyway

You got a one way ticket, on your last chance ride
Got a one way ticket to your suicide
Got a one way ticket, and there's no way out alive

An' all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is, then there's stories to be told
No, you don't need a doctor, no one else can heal your soul

Got your mind in submission, got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger, they just stepped aside
They be down by the water
While you watch 'em waving goodbye

They be calling in the morning, they be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer, but you know nobody's home
When the bell's stopped ringing
It was nobody's fault, but your own

There were always ample warnings
There were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it coming
But we gave you too much time
And when you said that no one's listening
Why'd your best friend drop a dime?
Sometimes, we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time

An' it's so easy to be social
It's so easy to be cool
Yeah, it's easy to be hungry, when you ain't got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find

But I'm still out here, waiting
Watching reruns of my life
When you reach the point of breaking
Know it's gonna take some time
To heal the broken memories
That another man would need just to survive
###Wouldn't It Be Nice###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

[Chorus 1]
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

[Chorus 2]
Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice

[Bridge]
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (We could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice

[Outro]
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Oh, wouldn't it be nice

Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby
###God Only Knows###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

[Chorus]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 2]
If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

[Chorus]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
God only knows what I'd be without you

[Verse 2]
If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

[Harmonizing Outro]
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows

[Harmonizing -- fade out]
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
###Good Vibrations###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)

Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

[Chorus]
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Exci - tations)

[Outro]
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)

She's giving me excitations (Excitations, bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Na na na na na, na na na (Ba da da, duh da, da)
###Sloop John B###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
Well I feel so broke up
I want to go home

[Chorus]
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the Captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I want to go home, yeah yeah
Well I feel so broke up
I want to go home

[Verse 2]
The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the Cap'n's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone, yeah yeah
Well I feel so broke up
I want to go home

[Chorus]
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the Captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I want to go home, let me go home
Why don't you let me go home
(Hoist up the John B's sail)
Hoist up the John B
I feel so broke up
I want to go home
Let me go home

[Verse 3]
The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home
This is the worst trip I've ever been on

[Chorus]
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the Captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I wanna go home, let me go home
Why don't you let me go home
###Kokomo###The Beach Boys
[Intro]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Jamaica

[Verse 1]
Off the Florida Keys
There's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go
To get away from it all
Bodies in the sand
Tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love
To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

[Chorus]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo

Martinique, that Montserrat mystique

[Verse 2]
We'll put out to sea
We'll perfect our chemistry
By and by we'll defy
A little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight
Cocktails and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye
Give me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

[Chorus]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast
And then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo

Port au Prince, I want to catch a glimpse

[Saxophone Break]

Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go to get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

[Chorus]
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
Ooh I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast

That's where we wanna go
Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego
Baby why don't we go
###California Girls###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
Well East coast girls are hip
I really dig those styles they wear
And the Southern girls with the way they talk
They knock me out when I'm down there
The Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright
And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

[Hook]
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California girls

[Verse 2]
The West coast has the sunshine
And the girls all get so tanned
I dig a french bikini on Hawaii island
Dolls by a palm tree in the sand
I been all around this great big world
And I seen all kinds of girls
Yeah, but I couldn't wait to get back in the states
Back to the cutest girls in the world

[Hook]

I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
I wish they all could be California
(Girls, girls, girls yeah I dig the)
###Surf's Up###The Beach Boys
A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome man and baton
(Bygone, bygone)
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
(Bygone, bygone)
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?

Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

Dove nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne

The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die

A choke of grief heart hardened, I
Beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's Up, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song

Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
A children's song
Have you listened as they played
Their song is love
And the children know the way
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child
Child, child, child, child, child
Na na na na na na na na
Child, child, child, child, child
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child
###I Get Around###The Beach Boys
[Chorus: Brian Wilson and Mike Love]
Round round get around

Get around round round I get around
From town to town
Get around round round I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around round round I get around
I'm making real good bread

[Verse 1: Mike Love]
I'm getting bugged driving up and down this same old strip
I got to find a new place where the kids are hip
My buddies and me are getting real well-known
Yeah, the bad guys know us and they leave us alone

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I get around
Get around round round I get around
From town to town
Get around round round I get around

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
We always take my car cause it's never been beat
And we've never missed yet with the girls we meet
None of the guys go steady cause it wouldn't be right
To leave their best girl home on a Saturday night

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
I get around
Get around round round I get around
From town to town
Get around round round I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around round round I get around
I'm making real good bread
Get around round round I get around

Round round get around

###In My Room###The Beach Boys
There's a world where I can go
And tell my secrets to
In my room
In my room

In this world I lock out
All my worries and my fears
In my room
In my room

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday

Now it's dark and I'm alone
But I won't be afraid
In my room
In my room
###I Just Wasn't Made for These Times###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind
They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

[Pre-Chorus]
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

[Verse 2]
Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found
Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

[Pre-Chorus]
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
I guess I just wasn't made for these times

[Outro]
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
###Little Deuce Coupe###The Beach Boys
[Intro]

Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

[Verse 1]

Well I'm not bragging babe so don't put me down
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
When something comes up to me he don't even try
Cause if I had a set of wings man I know she could fly

[Chorus]

She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)

[Verse 2]

Just a little deuce coupe with a flathead mill
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standing still
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored
Shell do a hundred and forty with the top end floored

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip daddy

[Verse 3]

And coming off the line when the light turns green
Well she blows them out of the water like you never seen
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
When I get rubber in all four gears

[Outtro]

She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
###That's Not Me###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1: Mike Love]
I had to prove that I could make it alone now
But that's not me
I wanted to show how independent I'd grown now
But that's not me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl

[Chorus 1: Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
I'm a little bit scared cause I haven't been home in a long time
You needed my love and I know that I left at the wrong time

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
My folks when I wrote them
Told 'em what I was up to said that's not me
I went through all kinds of changes
Took a look at myself and said that's not me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
I miss my pad and the places I've known
And every night as I lay there alone I would dream

[Chorus 2: Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I'm glad I went now I'm that much more sure that we're ready
I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
###You Still Believe in Me###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me
Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

[Chorus]
You still believe in me

[Verse 2]
I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me
I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully

[Chorus]
You still believe in me

[Outro]
I want to cry
###Don't Worry Baby###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
Well its been building up inside of me
For oh I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says "Don't worry baby"
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

[Chorus]
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

[Verse 2]
I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
When she says "Don't worry baby"
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

[Chorus]
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

[Verse 3]
She told me "Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you"
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says "Don't worry baby"
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

[Chorus]
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
###Heroes and Villains###The Beach Boys
I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long long time

Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains

Once at night catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Stand or fall I know there
Shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started so long ago
Head to toe, healthy weathy and wise

I've been in this town so long
So long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff
To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm alright
By the heroes and

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done

Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
###Caroline, No###The Beach Boys
Where did your long hair go
Where is the girl I used to know
How could you lose that happy glow
Oh Caroline, no
Who took that look away
I remember how you used to say
You'd never change, but that's not true
Oh Caroline, you
Break my heart
I want to go and cry
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
Oh, Caroline why
Could I ever find in you again
The things that made me love you so much then
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone
Oh Caroline, no
###Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
I can hear so much in your sighs
And I can see so much in your eyes
There are words we both could say

[Chorus]
But don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Come close
Close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand
And let me hear your heart beat

[Verse 2]
Being here with you feels so right
We could live forever tonight
Let's not think about tomorrow

[Chorus]
And don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Come close
Close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand
And listen to my heart beat

[Bridge]
Listen, listen, listen

[Instrumental with strings lead]

[Chorus]
Don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk
Close your eyes and be still

Don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk
Close your eyes and be still
Don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
###Fun, Fun, Fun###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
Well she got her daddy's car and she cruised to the hamburger stand, now
Seems she forgot all about the library like she told her old man, now
But with the radio blasting goes cruising just as fast as she can now
And she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away
(fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the T-bird away)

[Verse 2]
Well the girls can't stand her cause she walks, looks and drives like an Ace, now
(You walk like an ace now, you walk like an ace)
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race, now
(You look like an ace now, you look like an ace)
A lot of guys try to catch her, but she leads them on a wild goose chase, now
And she'll have fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away
(fun, fun, fun, 'till her daddy takes the T-bird away)

[Verse 3]
Well you knew all along that your dad was getting wise to you, now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
And since he took your set of keys you've been thinking that your fun is all through, now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)

But you can come along with me cause we've got a lot of things to do, now
(You shouldn't have lied now, you shouldn't have lied)
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
(fun, fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
And we'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
(fun, fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)

[Outro]
Wooo-ooo-Aaaah!
(fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
Wooo-ooo-Aaaah!
(fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
Wooo-ooo-Aaaah!
(fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun, now her daddy took the T-bird away)
###I Know There's an Answer###The Beach Boys
[Verse 1]
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive?

[Chorus]
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

[Verse 2]
They come on like they're peaceful but inside they're so uptight
They trip through their day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better

[Chorus]
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

[Instrumental break and verse]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that they live could be better

[Chorus]
I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself
###Lonely Boy###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Well, I'm so above you and it's plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out and I don't mind bleedin'
Any old time you keep me waitin'
Waitin', waitin'

[Chorus]
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'

[Verse 2]
Well, your mama kept you, but your daddy left you
And I shoulda done you just the same
But I came to love you, am I born to bleed?
Any old time you keep me waitin'
Waitin', waitin'

[Chorus]
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Hey

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy
Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin'
###Little Black Submarines###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Little black submarines
Operator, please put me back on the line
Told my girl I'd be back
Operator, please
This is wreckin' my mind

[Chorus]
Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

[Verse 2]
Pick you up, let you down
When I wanna go to a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans
But they just disappeared to the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

[Verse 3]
Treasure maps, fallen trees
Operator, please call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease
Operator, please patch me back to my mind

[Chorus]
Oh, can it be?
The voices calling me
They get lost and out of time
I should've seen it glow
But everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
###Weight of Love###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
I used to think, darlin', you never did nothin'
But you were always up to somethin'
Always had a run in, yeah
I got to think those days are comin' to get ya
Now no body want to protect yah
They only want to forget yah

[Chorus]
You'll be on my mind

The weight of, weight of love

Don't give yourself away
The weight of, weight of love

###Tighten Up###The Black Keys
[Whistling]

[Verse 1]
I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for you
Oh, what can I do? Yeah

[Verse 2]
Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin' you, baby child
Tighten up on your reins
You are runnin' wild, runnin' wild, it's true

[Verse 3]
Sick for days in so many ways
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now
It's times like these I need relief
Please show me how, oh show me how to get right
Yeah, it's out of sight

[Verse 4]
When I was young and movin' fast
Nothin' slowed me down, oh, slowed me down
Now I let the others pass, I've come around
Oh come around, 'cause I've found

[Outro / Bridge]
Livin' just to keep goin'
Goin' just to be sane
All the while not knowin'
It's such a shame

I don't need to get steady
I know just how I feel
I'm tellin' you to be ready
My dear
###Gold on the Ceiling###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Down in the waves
She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind can't take much more

[Pre-Chorus]
I could never drown in

[Chorus]
They wanna get my
They wanna get my gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind, just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's all right, ain't no guarding my high

[Verse 2]
Clouds covered love's
Barb-wired snare
Strung up, strung out
I just can’t go without

[Pre-Chorus]
I could never drown in

[Chorus]
They wanna get my
They wanna get my gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind, just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's all right, ain't no guarding my high

They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind, just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's all right, ain't no guarding my high
###Howlin' For You###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
I must admit, I can't explain
Any of these thoughts racin' through my brain, it's true
Baby I'm howlin' for you

[Verse 2]
There's something wrong, with this plot
The actors here have not got a clue
Baby I'm howlin' for you

[Chorus]
Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da

Mockingbird, can't you see
Little girl's got a hold on me, like glue

Throw the ball, to the stick
Swing and miss and catcher's mitt, strike two
Baby I'm howlin' for you

Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da
###Fever###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Fever, where'd you run to?
Fever, where'd you run to?
Acting right is so routine
Fever let me live a dream
Fever I'm a slave to
No one misbehave too
Fever that misunderstood
Wouldn't leave you if I could
Fever

[Chorus]
Fever cause I'm breaking
Fever got me aching
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again
Fever got me guilty
Just go ahead and kill me
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again

[Verse 2]
Fever, can you hear me?
Fever, can you hear me?
You shook me like I never been
Now show me how to live again
It used to be a blessing
But fever's got me stressing
Realize I am to blame
But fever let me play the game
Fever

[Chorus]
Fever cause I'm breaking
Fever got me aching
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again
Fever got me guilty
Just go ahead and kill me
Fever, why don't you explain?
Break it down again

[Outro]
Now if the cold, pale, light in your eyes
Reaches those horizon lines
You know not to leave her
Now if the cold, pale, light in your eyes
Reaches those horizon lines
You know not to leave her
Fever
###Gotta Get Away###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
I got paid, then I was on the road
In a heartbeat, Mama said Mama said
You got a one track mind, but you ain't gonna get it all the time
She wasn't lyin'

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

[Verse 2]
My last dime, got used up
On gasoline, know what I mean, what I mean
Atlanta, GA by the end of the day
No other way, that's what I say

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone

[Bridge]
And everything I had to say
Wish we'd gone so far away
Well now I
Can't stay

[Verse 3]
Blacktop, I can't stop
For no one, it's no fun, no fun
With a one track mind if you don't get lucky some time
But still I'm tryin'

[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hopin' I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
###Everlasting Light###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Let me be your everlasting light
The sun when there is none
I'm a shepherd for you
And I will guide you through
Let me be your everlasting light

[Verse 2]
Let me be your everlasting light
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
I'll hold and never scold
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
In me you can confide
When no one's by your side
Let me be your everlasting light
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

[Bridge]
Oh baby, can't you see
It's shining just for you
Loneliness is over
Dark days are through
They are through
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)

[Verse 3]
Let me be your everlasting light
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
A train going ‘way from pain
(Shoo-shoo-shoo-wa)
Love is the coal
That makes this train roll
Let me be your everlasting light
Yeah

[Outro]
Let me be your everlasting light
Let me be your everlasting light
Be your everlasting light
Ohh
###10 Lovers###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
When I hear them use your name
I get all choked up inside
It's not only from the shame
It's like 10 different lovers died
Except you're still just a mile away
But there's nothing left to say

[Chorus]
Don't leave us not in love again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little stain in the pouring rain
It washed away almost everything

[Verse 2]
If I found another love
They must be forever true
Cause if someone breaks this heart
Your old man right here is through
Heaven just seems so far away
When there's nothing left to say

[Chorus x2]

[Altered Chorus]
Don't leave us not in love again
The little girl can't comprehend
She had another dream that her mama's gone
She's alright, but you're all wrong
###The Only One###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Can't explain, nor can I contain
Control, you have on my soul
'Cause all I do, is baby dream of you
I'm fallin' down, when you're around

[Chorus]
You're the only one, you're the only one
I am so wrapped up in a daze
Hopin' this is just a phase
But when all is said and done
I know you are still the one
You're the only one, you're the only one
Cupid's bow it stung
Now you're the only one

[Verse 2]
Mystery, is what this is to me
I'm givin' up, I am having no luck
Like a ghost, the one that I love most
She disappears, when I get near

[Chorus]
You're the only one, you're the only one
I am so wrapped up in a daze
Hopin' this is just a phase
But when all is said and done
I know you are still the one
You're the only one, you're the only one
Cupid's bow it stung
Now you're the only one

[Outro]
O-o-only one, o-o-only one
O-o-only one, o-o-only one
O-o-only one, o-o-only one
O-o-only one, o-o-only one
###Next Girl###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Well the look on the cake it ain't
It ain't always the taste
My ex-girl she had such a
Such a beautiful face
I wanted love
But not for myself
But for the girl so she could
So she could love herself

[Chorus]
Oh my next girl
Will be nothing like my ex-girl
I made mistakes back then
I will never do it again
Oh my next girl
She will be nothing like my ex-girl
It was a painful dance
Now I got a second chance

[Verse 2]
Oh her beautiful face and her
And her wicked ways
And I am paying for her beautiful face every day
All that work over
Over so much time if I
If I think too hard I might lose my mind

[Chorus]
Oh my next girl
Will be nothing like my ex-girl
I made mistakes back then
I will never do it again
With my next girl
She will be nothing like my ex-girl
That was a painful dance
And I got a second chance

[Outro]
Oh my next girl
Yeah
My next girl
###Turn Blue###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
In the dead of the night I start to lose control
But I still carry the weight like I've always done before
It gets so heavy at times but what more can I do?
I got to stay on track just like Pops told me to

[Chorus]
I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below...below
I really do hope you know
There could be Hell below...below

[Verse 2]
When the music is done and all the lights are low
I will remember the times when love would really glow
Like a dream I had before my world turned blue
When the light inside would only shine for you

[Chorus x2]
I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below...below
I really do hope you know
There could be Hell below...below
###Too Afraid to Love You###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
My gears they grind
More each day
And I feel like
They are going to grind away

And the city blocks
They drive me wild
They're never ending
Mile after mile

[Chorus]
I just don't know what to do
I am too afraid to love you

[Verse 2]
It's heaven on earth
It's in her embrace
Her gentle touch
And her smilin' face

I am just one wishin'
That I was a pair
With someone
Oh somewhere

[Chorus]
I just don't know what to do
I am too afraid to love you

[Bridge]
All those sleepless nights
And all those wasted days
I wish loneliness would leave me
But I think it's here to stay

What more can I do
'Cause I'm wringin' myself dry
And I cannot afford to lose
One more teardrop from my eye
Whoa

[Outro]
I'm too afraid
I'm too afraid
I just don't know what to do
With myself
Thinkin' all the time

Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do

Drivin' me outta my mind
###In Our Prime###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Pour me down the drain, I disappear
Like every honest thing I used to hear

[Chorus]
Like every lover hovers in my mind
We made our mark when we were in our prime
The house it burned, but nothing there was mine
We had it all when we were in our prime

[Verse 2]
Every now and then I see your face from way back when and I explode
Friends no longer egg me on, they bullshit serenade me like it's gold, how then we're told
I'm praying for some laughter, maybe joy for ever after till I die
I'm hungry for a change, I got my fill of other's pain, I realized
Opened my eyes

[Chorus x2]
Like every lover hovers in my mind
We made our mark when we were in our prime
The house it burned, but nothing there was mine
We had it all when we were in our prime
###In Time###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Where do we go?
And all the people, they sure don't want you to know
They don't want you to know, oh
Livin' in chains, the heart's rearranged
You gotta lure it back, all of the time
Now tell me I'm right, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I got a thing I really can't say

[Chorus]
You've got a worried mind
I've got a worried heart
You don't know what to do
I don't know where to start
You let this beat us down
Well get up off the ground
One day, I know
We've got to go, oh

[Verse 2]
Where is your mind?
The street is beating you bad
It's taken it's time, it's taken it's time, oh
Nowhere to run?
I told you to get, but you were having your fun
Now you're under the gun, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I got a thing I really can't say

[Chorus]
You've got a worried mind
I've got a worried heart
You don't know what to do
I don't know where to start
You let this beat us down
Well get up off the ground
One day, I know
We've got to go, oh
###The Lengths###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Tell me where you're going
What is goin' wrong
I felt you leaving
Before you'd even gone
Hold me now
Or never, ever
Hold me again
No more talk
Could take me from this
Pain I'm in
Pain I'm in

[Verse 2]
See the moonlight shining
On your window pane
See it leave you
As faithful as it came
Please yourself
So you don't have to
Be afraid
Make amends
Or carry on another way
Another way

[Verse 3]
Tell me what you were thinking
To treat somebody so
The care he took
The lengths to which he'd go
The coals are hot
To walk across
Without your shoes
But in the end
Know that you've got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
###Waiting on Words###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
I'm waiting on words
I'm waiting on the one I've been thinking of
And hoping you heard
I'm waiting on the words

[Chorus]
Oh, goodbye
I heard you were leaving
Won't try changing your mind
Goodbye
Don't know where you're going
The only thing I really know
My love for you is real, I

[Verse 2]
I leave it behind
No longer will I want for a single thing
Stay true in my mind
You have to let 'em in

[Chorus x2]
Oh, goodbye
I heard you were leaving
Won't try changing your mind
Goodbye
Don't know where you're going
The only thing I really know
My love for you is real, I
###Ten Cent Pistol###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Well, he ran around late at night
Holding hands and making light
Of everything that came before
But there she was behind the door

[Chorus]
She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same

[Verse 2]
There is nothing worse in this world
Than payback from a jealous girl
The laws of man do not apply
When blood gets in a woman's eye

[Chorus]
She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same

[Verse 3]
Stars did fall, thunder rolled
Bugs crawled back, in their holes
The couple screamed, but it was far too late
A jealous heart, did retaliate

[Chorus]
She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same
###Sinister Kid###The Black Keys
[Verse 1]
Well, the crooks are out
And the streets are gray
You know I wouldn't have it
Any other way

Your mother's words
They're ringin' still
But your mother don't
Pay our bills

[Chorus]
A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his maker's arms
And that's me, that's me
The boy with the broken halo
That's me, that's me
The devil won't let me be

[Verse 2]
I got a tortured mind
And my blade is sharp
A bad combination
In the dark

If I kill a man
In the first degree
Baby would you
Flee with me?

[Chorus]
A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his maker's arms
And that's me, that's me
The boy with the broken halo
That's me, that's me
The devil won't let me be
###Smells Like Teen Spirit###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's over-bored and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Verse 2]
I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an Albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, hey, yay

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And I forget just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard, it's hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an albino
A mosquito, my libido

[Outro]
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
###Come as You Are###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As a known enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria

[Pre-Chorus]
Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

[Verse 2]
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

###Heart-Shaped Box###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

[Verse 2]
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of 'Your Highness', I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

[Chorus]
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head

###Polly###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

[Verse 2]
Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

[Verse 3]
Polly said
Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me the will of instinct

[Chorus]
Isn't me, have a seed
Let me clip your dirty wings
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
###Where Did You Sleep Last Night###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 3]
Her husband was a hard working man
Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

[Verse 4]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
(Shiver the whole night)

[Verse 5]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 6]
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 7]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, the pines
The sun don't shine
I'd shiver... the whole night through
(Thank you)
###All Apologies###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
What else should I be?
All apologies
What else could I say?
Everyone is gay
What else could I write?
I don't have the right
What else should I be?
All apologies

[Chorus]
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried

[Verse 2]
I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn, freezer burn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy

[Chorus]
In the sun, in the sun, I feel as one
In the sun, in the sun
Married, buried
Married, buried
Yeah, yeah, yeah ,yeah

###In Bloom###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

[Chorus]
He’s the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means

And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say yeah

Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

###The Man Who Sold The World###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
We passed up on the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

###Something in the Way###Nirvana
[Verse]
Underneath the bridge
Tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from my ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
'Cause they don't have any feelings

[Chorus]
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm
Something in the way, mmm
Something in the way, yeah, mmm

###Dumb###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb

[Chorus]
Or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy

[Verse 2]
My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale
And mend it with you
We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down

[Chorus]
And have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover
Have a hangover

[Bridge]
Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, the soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothing burn, wake me up

I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done

###About a Girl###Nirvana
[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue

[Chorus]
I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night free
(I do)

###Drain You###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[Chorus]
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

[Verse 2]
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

You, you, you
You, you, you

From my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins
I like you
###Territorial Pissings###Nirvana

Come on, people, now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

Never met a wise man
If so it's a woman

###Pennyroyal Tea###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture

[Chorus]
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty

[Verse 2]
Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally

I'm so tired I can't sleep
I'm a liar and a thief
Sit and drink Pennyroyal tea
I'm anemic royalty

###Breed###Nirvana
[Verse]
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

[Chorus]
Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said

[Verse]
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old

###Lounge Act###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

[Chorus]
And I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

[Chorus]
And I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

[Verse 3]
Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

[Chorus]
And I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We'll make a pact to learn from who
Ever we want without new rules
And we'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way to prove they still
Smell her on you
They still smell her on you
Smell her on you
###On a Plain###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
I'll start this off without any words
I got so high, I scratched 'till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Verse 2]
My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

[Bridge]
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

[Verse 3]
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, and I can go home
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[Chorus]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
###Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle###Nirvana
[Verse 1]
It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

[Verse 2]
In her false witness
Hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient
A display of patience
Disease-covered Puget sound
She'll come back as fire
To burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To know that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
###Everlong###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
And over my head, out of her head she sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder when I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Verse 2]
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
And out of your head, out of my head I sang

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wonder when I sing along with you

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

[Instrumental Break with whispering voices]

[Bridge]
And I wonder...

[Chorus]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
###The Sky Is a Neighborhood###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
The sky is a neighborhood
So keep it down
The heart is a storybook
A star burned out
The sky is a neighborhood
Don't make a sound
Lights coming up ahead
Don't look now

[Pre-Chorus]
The sky is a neighborhood
The sky is a neighborhood
Don't look now

[Chorus]
Oh, my dear
Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear
Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

[Verse 2]
Mind is a battlefield
All hope is gone
Trouble to the right and left
Whose side you're on?
Thoughts like a minefield
I'm a ticking bomb
Maybe you should watch your step
Don't get lost

[Pre-Chorus]
The sky is a neighborhood
The sky is a neighborhood
Don't get lost

[Chorus]
Oh, my dear
Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear
Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

[Bridge]
The sky is a neighborhood

[Verse 3]
The heart is a storybook
A star burned out
Something coming up ahead
Don't look now

[Chorus]
Oh, my dear
Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
Oh, my dear
Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down
(The sky is a neighborhood)
Oh, my dear
Heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
(The sky is a neighborhood)
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

[Outro]
The sky is a neighborhood

Wake up
Run for your life with me
Wake up
Run for your life with me

[Chorus]
In another perfect life
In another perfect light
We run

The rats are on parade
Another mad charade
What you gonna do?
The hounds are on the chase
Everything's erased

###The Pretender###Foo Fighters
[Intro]
Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

[Verse 1]
Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready
Are you ready
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never ending
Never ending
Same old story

[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

[Verse 2]
In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent, we're
Temporary, temporary
Same old story

[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

[Bridge]
I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirroring your stare
I'm what's left
I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down
Bring you to your knees
So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

[Breakdown]
Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend

[Chorus]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

[Outro]
What if I say I'm not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all)
You're the pretender
(Pretend)
What if I say I will never surrender?
What if I say I'm not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
(You know they all)
You're the pretender
(Pretend)
What if I say I will never surrender?
So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
###Best of You###Foo Fighters
[Intro]
I've got another confession to make, I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break, holdin' you
Were you born to resist or be abused?

[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Verse 1]
Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have, but had no use
I was too weak to give in, too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again, but I break loose
My head is giving me life or death, but I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Oh, oh oh, oh oh

[Bridge]
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess

[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Verse 2]
I've got another confession, my friend, I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new
Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

[Chorus]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
###All My Life###Foo Fighters
[Intro]
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost

[Verse 1]
Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there?
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

[Chorus]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

[Verse 2]
Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I've got nothing to hide
On and on, I've got nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

[Bridge]
All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies, but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost
And I'm done, done, on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next...

Done, done, on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done; on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next...

[Chorus]
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

[Outro]
Done, done and on to the next one
Done, I'm done, and I'm
On to the next
###Learn to Fly###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
Run and tell all of the angels
This could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution
Cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die

[Chorus]
Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of lying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

[Verse 2]
I think I'm done nursing the patience
It can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright

[Chorus 2]
Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to...

[Bridge]
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own
Fly along with me, I can't quite make it alone
Try to make this life my own

[Chorus 2]
I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to

I'm looking to the sky to save me
Looking for a sign of life
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
I'm looking for a complication
Looking cause I'm tired of trying
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high
Make my way back home when I learn to fly...
Make my way back home when I learn to...
###My Hero###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
Too alarming now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

[Verse 2]
Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

[Bridge]
Kudos, my hero
Leaving all the best
You know my hero
The one that's on

[Chorus]
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary
###Walk###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Gettin' good at startin' over
Every time that I return

[Chorus]
I'm learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the days
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn?
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growin' stronger?
Little conquerors

[Chorus]
I'm learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learnin' to talk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?

[Bridge]
Now
For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free again
To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice but knowin' to survive
The first to climb another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never want to die
I never want to die, I never want to die
I'm on my knees, I never want to die
I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire
Forever, whenever, I never want to die
I never want to leave, I never say goodbye
Forever, whenever, forever, whenever

[Chorus]
I'm learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
I'm learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

[Outro]
I'm learnin' to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
I'm learnin' to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
###Monkey Wrench###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on planning my revenge

[Pre-Chorus]
One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

[Chorus]
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

[Verse 2]
All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then I'll try to bend
Under pressure wind up snapping in the end

[Pre-Chorus]
One in ten
One in ten
One in ten

[Chorus]
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

Temper
Temper
Temper

[Bridge]
One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than I could fit
Into my head
I still remember every single word you said
And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free

[Chorus]
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

[Outro]
Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench (fall in, fall out)
Don't want to be your monkey wrench
###Arrows###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
She was a friend of mine
Alone on a dead end street
Dancing through life
On the front lines

She led a quiet life
Ends, they don't always meet
Years passed her by
Waiting to rise

[Pre-Chorus]
She had arrows in her eyes
Fear where her heart should be
War in her mind

[Chorus]
Arrows in her eyes
Fear where her heart should be
War in her mind
Shame in her cries

Arrows in her eyes
Tears in her arteries
War in her mind
Shame as she cries
Fire away

[Verse 2]
Under a silent light
Screaming biology
Queen Gemini
The world in her sights

I want a new life
Forming inside of me
Blessed and born
Into this fire

[Pre-Chorus]
You had arrows in your eyes
Fear where your heart should be
War in your mind

[Chorus]
Arrows in her eyes
Fear where your heart should be
War in your mind
Shame in your cries

Arrows in your eyes
Tears in your arteries
War in your mind
Shame as you cry
Fire away

[Chorus]
Arrows in her eyes
Fear where her heart should be
War in her mind
Shame in her cries

Arrows in her eyes
Tears in her arteries
War in her mind
Shame as she cries
Fire away
###Big Me###Foo Fighters
[Verse]
When I talk about it
Carries on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or treasons all renew

[Chorus]
Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

[Post-Chorus]
Well, I talked about it
Carried on
Reasons only knew
But it's you I fell into

[Verse]
Well, I talked about it
Carried on
Reasons only knew
When I talk about it
Aries or treasons all renew

[Chorus]
Big me to talk about it
I could stand to prove
If we can get around it
I know that it's true

[Post-Chorus]
Well, I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you I fell into

Well, I talked about it
Put it on
Never was it true
But it's you I fell into
I fell into
I fell into
###These Days###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
One of these days
The ground will drop out from beneath your feet
One of these days
Your heart will stop and play its final beat
One of these days
The clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing
One of these days
Their bombs will drop and silence everything

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright
I said it's alright

[Chorus]
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet
One of these days
I bet your heart'll be broken
I bet your pride'll be stolen
I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet
One of these days
One of these days

Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen

###Times like These###Foo Fighters
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I, I'm a one way motorway
I'm the one that drives away, follows you back home
I, I'm a street light shining
I'm a white light blinding bright, burning off and on

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

[Verse 2]
I, I'm a new day rising
I'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
But I, I'm a little divided
Do I stay or run away and leave it all behind?

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again

[Instrumental Break with vocalizations]

[Chorus]
It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again

It's times like these you learn to live again
It's times like these you give and give again
It's times like these you learn to love again
It's times like these time and time again
###La Dee Da###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
Look out 'cause you know what you're doing
Turn up the American ruse
Whitehouse, Death in June
Jim Jones painting in a blue bedroom
You don't know this, La Dee Da
You don't own this, how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know this, La Dee Da?
Got me goin', how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Dear god

Hate!

###Dirty Water###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
I've been drinking dirty water
But I've been here before, after all
The witching hour is upon us
You and I can sing haunted songs
In my dreams I'm climbing ladders
And then I tumble down, rung by rung
And I keep on falling faster
The heart is echoing, on and on
On and on

[Chorus]
I feel an earthquake coming on
I feel the metal in my bones
'Cause I'm a natural disaster
You're the morning after all my storms

[Verse 2]
You're my sea of poison flowers
Standing in the sun, row by row
I've been drinking dirty water
The taste of sweet revenge, best served cold
All we know

[Chorus]
I feel an earthquake coming on
I feel the metal in my bones
I'm a natural disaster
And you're the morning after all my storms

[Bridge]
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky
Bleed dirty water
Breathe dirty sky

[Chorus]
I feel an earthquake coming on
I feel the metal in my bones
'Cause I'm a natural disaster
Dirty water in my blood
I feel a moment coming on
Heavy metal in my bones
'Cause I'm a natural disaster
You're the morning after all my storms
###Something from Nothing###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
Give me the flammable life
I'm cold as a match, ready to strike
So here I go
Here lies a city on fire
Singing along, the arsonist choir
Now here I go
It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now, here I go
There is a river I found
Into the wild, under the ground
So here I go
A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now, here I go, well

[Bridge]
Oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
You have no choice you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way
But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go, well
Oh, sweet ignition be my fuse
You had no choice you had to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry I could lie
You took my word, I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Looking for a dime and found a quarter

[Chorus]
But you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now ain't that's something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

[Bridge]
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
It goes oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
It goes oh, oh, oh
Alright

[Chorus]
No you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now wait that's something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

[Outro]
I'm something from nothing
I'm something from nothing
###T-Shirt###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be king
I just wanna sing a love song
Pretend there's nothing wrong
You can sing along with me
I don't wanna be queen
Just trying to keep my t-shirt clean

[Verse 2]
There's one thing that I have learned
If it gets much better, it's going to get worse

[Verse 3]
And you get what you deserve
And you get what you deserve
###Make It Right###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
Everybody needs, everybody needs
Needs a little suffer
I just wanna do, I just wanna do
Do a little number
Bite the hand that feeds, bite the hand that feeds
Bite a little harder
What's it gonna take, what's it gonna take
Gonna take a lover?

[Chorus]
Hop on the train to nowhere, baby
Don't you wanna hitch a ride?
Lights go out and your head starts spinnin'
Someone got you hypnotized
Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo
Brother, can you spare a dime?
Count what's left when it's all gone wrong
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?

[Verse 2]
Everybody breathe, everybody breathe
Breathe a little deeper
Got no soul to keep, got no soul to keep
Ain't no brother's keeper
I don't fuckin' need, I don't fuckin' need
I don't need a martyr
Who's it gonna be? Who's it gonna be?
Gonna be another

[Chorus]
Hop on the train to nowhere, baby
Don't you wanna hitch a ride?
Lights go out and your head starts spinnin'
Someone got you hypnotized
Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo
Brother, can you spare a dime?
Count what's left when it's all gone wrong
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?
Gonna make it right
How you gonna make it right?
Make it right

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Hop on the train to nowhere, baby
Don't you wanna hitch a ride?
Lights go out and your head starts spinnin'
Someone got you hypnotized
Down on the chain, your bad tuxedo
Brother, can you spare a dime?
Count what's left when it's all gone wrong
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?
How you gonna make it right?
Gonna make it right
Gonna make it right
###Sunday Rain###Foo Fighters
[Verse 1]
You say I take it for granted
I say you've taken it all
Say you can take it or leave it
You got your head in the ceiling
When are you gonna come down?
When you're that high, can you feel it?

[Chorus]
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

[Verse 2]
You wanna tell me a secret
You think I'm gonna find out
You tell the lie, you should keep it
Don't wanna know where it's leading
Don't want to follow you 'round
My first mistake was believing

[Chorus]
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

[Bridge]
Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Do you let go?
Where do you find it?

[Chorus]
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's right down the drain I go
Don't leave me drowning in your Sunday rain
It's always a shame, oh no

[Bridge]
Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Do you let go?
How do you find it?

Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Do you let go?
How do you find it?

Are you a little afraid?
A little alone?
A little exhausted?
Do you give it away?
Do you let go?
###Lola###The Kinks
I met her in a club down in North Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like
Cherry Cola
C-O-L-A Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, "Lola"
L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo  lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, "Little boy won't you come home with me?"
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes
I almost fell for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

I pushed her away. I walked to the door
I fell to the floor. I got down on my knees
I looked at her, and she at me
Well that's the way that I want it to stay
I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo lo lo Lola
Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo  loLola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola

Well I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, "Little boy, gonna make you a man."
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
So is Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola

[Outro]
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
###Waterloo Sunset###The Kinks
[Verse 1]
Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

[Chorus]
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

[Verse 2]
Terry meets Julie, Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy, don't want to wander
I stay at home at night
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

[Chorus]
Every day I look at the world from my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

[Verse 3]
Millions of people swarming like flies round Waterloo underground
But Terry and Julie cross over the river
Where they feel safe and sound
And they don't need no friends
As long as they gaze on Waterloo sunset
They are in paradise

Waterloo sunset's fine
###Sunny Afternoon###The Kinks
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everythin' I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me

And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime

[Verse 2]
My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty

Now I'm sitting here
Sipping at my ice cold beer
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

[Chorus]
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well, give me two good reasons why I ought to stay

'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime

Oh, save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me

And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime
###Strangers###The Kinks
[Verse 1: The Kinks]
Where are you going I don't mind
I've killed my world and I've killed my time
So where do I go what do I see
I see many people coming after me
So where are you going to I don't mind
If I live too long I'm afraid I'll die
So I will follow you wherever you go
If your offered hand is still open to me

[Chorus]
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

[Verse 2: The Kinks]
So you've been where I've just come
From the land that brings losers on
So we will share this road we walk
And mind our mouths and beware our talk
'Till peace we find tell you what I'll do
All the things I own I will share with you
And, if I feel tomorrow, like, I feel today
We'll take what we want and give the rest away

[Chorus]
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one

[Verse 3: The Kinks]
Holy man and holy priest
This love of life makes me weak at my knees
And when we get there make your play
'Cos soon I feel you're gonna carry us away
In a promised lie you made us believe
For many men there is so much grief
And my mind is proud but it aches with rage
And, if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die

[Outro]
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
Strangers on this road we are on
We are not two we are one
###A Well Respected Man###The Kinks
Cause he gets up in the morning
And he goes to work at nine
And he comes back home at five-thirty
Gets the same train every time
Cause his world is built round punctuality
It never fails

And he's oh, so good
And he's oh, so fine
And he's oh, so healthy
In his body and his mind
He's a well respected man about town
Doing the best things so conservatively

And his mother goes to meetings
While his father pulls the maid
And she stirs the tea with councilors
While discussing foreign trade
And she passes looks, as well as bills
At every suave young man

Cause he's oh, so good
And he's oh, so fine
And he's oh, so healthy
In his body and his mind
He's a well respected man about town
Doing the best things so conservatively

And he likes his own backyard
And he likes his fags the best
Cause he's better than the rest
And his own sweat smells the best
And he hopes to grab his fathers loot
When pater passes on

Cause he's oh, so good
And he's oh, so fine
And he's oh, so healthy
In his body and his mind
He's a well respected man about town
Doing the best things so conservatively

And he plays at stocks and shares
And he goes to the regatta
And he adores the girl next door
Cause he's dying to get at her
But his mother knows the best about
The matrimonial stakes

Cause he's oh, so good
And he's oh, so fine
And he's oh, so healthy
In his body and his mind
He's a well respected man about town
Doing the best things so conservatively

###All Day and All of the Night###The Kinks
I'm not content to be with you in the daytime
Girl I want to be with you all of the time
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl I want to be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All day and all of the night

###Victoria###The Kinks
Long ago life was clean
Sex was bad, thought obscene
And the rich were so mean
Stately homes for the Lords
Croquet lawns, village greens
Victoria was my queen
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria

I was born, lucky me
In a land that I love
Though I am poor, I am free
When I grow I shall fight
For this land I shall die
Let her sun never set
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, toria

Land of hope and gloria
Land of my Victoria
Land of hope and gloria
Land of my Victoria
Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria

Canada to India
Australia to Cornwall
Singapore to Hong Kong
From the West to the East
From the rich to the poor
Victoria loved them all
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria, 'toria
Victoria, Victoria, Victoria
###Apeman###The Kinks
[Verse 1]
I think I'm sophisticated
'Cause I'm living my life like a good homosapien
But all around me everybody's multiplying
'Til they're walking round like flies man
So I'm no better than the animals sitting in their cages
In the zoo man
'Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees
I am an ape man

[Verse 2]
I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized
'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation
And the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an ape man

[Chorus]
I'm an ape man
I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man
I'm woo-doo man
I'm an ape man
'Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies
I am an ape man

[Spoken Interlude]
In man's evolution he has created the cities and
The motor traffic rumble, but give me half a chance
And I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle

[Chorus]
'Cause the only time that I feel at ease
Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree
Oh what a life of luxury
To be like an ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man
I'm a voodoo man
I'm an ape man
I look out my window, but I can't see the sky
'Cause the air pollution is a-fogging up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive
And make like an ape man

[Bridge]
Come on and love me
Be my ape man girl
And we will be so happy
In my ape man world

[Chorus]
I'm an ape man
I'm an ape ape man
I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man
I'm a voodoo man
I'm an ape man
I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane
And we'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day
Just like an ape man
I'm an ape man, I'm an ape ape man, I'm an ape man
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodoo man
I'm an ape man
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore
And make like an ape man
###This Time Tomorrow###The Kinks
This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere sailing across an empty sea
This time tomorrow what will we know
Will we still be here watching an in-flight movie show
I'll leave the sun behind me and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
Seven miles below me I can see the world and it ain't so big at all
This time tomorrow what will we see
Field full of houses, endless rows of crowded streets
I don't know where I'm going, I don't want to see
I feel the world below me looking up at me
Leave the sun behind me, and watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by
I'm in perpetual motion and the world below doesn't matter much to me
This time tomorrow where will we be
On a spaceship somewhere sailing across any empty sea
This time tomorrow where will we be
This time tomorrow what will we see
This time tomorrow
###You Really Got Me###The Kinks
[Verse 1]
Girl, you really got me goin'
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

[Hook]
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me

[Verse 2]
See, don't ever set me free
I always want to be by your side
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

[Hook]

Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

[Hook]
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
###Shangri-La###The Kinks
Now that you've found your paradise
This is your kingdom to command
You can go outside and polish your car
Or sit by the fire in your Shangri-La
Here's your reward for working so hard:
Gone are the lavat'ries in the back yard;
Gone are the days when you dreamed of that car
You just want to sit in your Shangri-La
Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
You've reached your top and you just can't get any higher
You're in your place and you know where you are
In your Shangri-La
Sit back in your old rocking-chair
You need not worry, you need not care
You can't go anywhere!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!
The little man who gets the train got a mortgage hangin' over his head?
But he's to scared to complain, cause he's conditioned that way
Time goes by and he pays off his debt, got a T.V. set and a radio
For seven shillings a week
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!

And all the houses in the street have got a name
Cause all the houses in the street; they look the same:
Same chimney puff; same little car; same window pane!
The neighbors call to tell you things that you should know
They say their lines; they drink their tea; and then they go!
They tell your business in another Shangri-La!
The gas bills and the water rates, the payments on the car!
Too scared to think about how insecure you are!
Life ain't so happy in your little Shangri-La!
Oh, Shangri-La! Shangri-La

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la;
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la;
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
You've reached your top and you just can't get any higher
You're in your place and you know where you are
In your Shangri-La
Sit back in your old rocking-chair
You need not worry, you need not care
You can't go anywhere!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!

###Picture Book###The Kinks
Picture yourself when you're getting on
Sat by the fireside a-pondering on

###Living On A Thin Line###The Kinks
All the stories have been told
Of kings and days of old
But there's no England now

All the wars that were won and lost
Somehow don't seem to matter very much anymore
All the lies we were told
All the lies of the people running round
Their castles have burned
Now I see change
But inside we're the same as we ever were

Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Living this way, each day is a dream
What am I, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?

Now another century nearly gone
What are we gonna leave for the young?
What we couldn't do, what we wouldn't do
It's a crime, but does it matter?
Does it matter much, does it matter much to you?
Does it ever really matter?
Yes, it really, really matters

Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?

Now another leader says
Break their hearts and break some heads
Is there nothing we can say or do?
Blame the future on the past
Always lost in blood and guts
And when they're gone, it's me and you

Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
Tell me now, what are we supposed to do?
Living on a thin line
###Father Christmas###The Kinks
When I was small, I believed in Santa Claus
Though I knew it was my dad
And I would hang up my stockings at Christmas
Open my presents, and I'd be glad
But the last time I played Father Christmas
I stood outside a department store
A gang of kids came over and mugged me
And knocked my reindeer to the floor
They said

Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Don't give my brother a Steve Austin outfit
Don't give my sister a cuddly toy
We don't want no Jinx or Monopoly money
We only want the real McCoy

Father Christmas, give us some money
We'll beat you up if you make us some wine
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys

Give my daddy a job 'cause he needs one
He's got lots of mouths to feed
But if you've got one, I'll take a machine gun
So I can scare all the kids on the street

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
We'll beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Have yourself a merry merry Christmas
Have yourself a good time
But remember the kids who got nothing
While you're drinking down your wine

Father Christmas, give us some money
We got no time for your silly toys
Father Christmas please hand it over we'll beat up don't make us annoyed
Father Christmas, give us some money
Don't mess around with those silly toys
Beat you up if you don't hand it over
We want your bread so don't make us annoyed
Give all the toys to the little rich boys
###Better Things###The Kinks
Here's wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way

Here's hoping all the days ahead
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you
Be an optimist instead
And somehow happiness will find you
Forget what happened yesterday
I know that better things are on the way

It's really good to see you rocking out and having fun
Living like you just begun
Accept your life and what it brings
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things

Here's wishing you the bluest sky
And hoping something better comes tomorrow
Hoping all the verses rhyme
And the very best of choruses to
Follow all the doubt and sadness
I know that better things are on the way

I know you've got a lot of good things happening up ahead
The past is gone, it's all been said
So here's to what the future brings
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
I know tomorrow you'll find better things
I hope tomorrow you'll find better things
###Big Sky###The Kinks
Big Sky looked down on all the people looking up at the Big Sky
Everybody's pushing one another around
Big Sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry
But the Big Sky's too big to let it get him down

Big Sky too big to cry
Big Sky too high to see
People like you and me

One day we'll be free
We won't care, just you see
'Til that day can be
Don't let it get you down

And when I feel
That the world's too much for me
I think of the Big Sky
And nothing matters much to me

Big Sky looked down on all the people who think they got problems
They get depressed and they hold their heads in their hands and they cry
People lift up their hands and they look up to the Big Sky
But the Big Sky is too big to sympathise

Big Sky's too occupied
Though he would like to try
And he feels bad inside
Big Sky's too big to cry

One day we'll be free
We won't care, just you wait and see
'Til that day can be
Don't let it get you down
###Destroyer###The Kinks
Met a girl called Lola and I took her back to my place
Feelin' guilty, feelin' scared, hidden cameras everywhere
Stop! Hold on, stay in control

Girl, I want you here with me
But I'm really not as cool as I'd like to be
Cause there's a red, under my bed
And there's a little yellow man in my head
And there's a true blue inside of me
That keeps stoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya

Paranoia, the destroyer
Paranoia, the destroyer

Well I fell asleep, then I woke feelin' kinda queer
Lola looked at me and said, ooh, you look so weird
She said, man, there's really something wrong with you
One day you're gonna self-destruct
You're up, you're down, I can't work you out
You get a good thing goin' then you blow yourself out

Silly boy you self-destroyer
Silly boy you self-destroyer

Silly boy you got so much to live for
So much to aim for, so much to try for
You blowing it all with paranoia
You're so insecure you self-destroyer

(and it goes like this, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(here it goes again)
Paranoia, the destroyer

Doctor, doctor help me please, I know you'll understand
There's a time device inside of me, I'm a self-destructin' man
There's a red, under my bed
And there's a little green man in my head
And he said, you're not goin' crazy, you're just a bit sad
Cause there's a man in ya, gnawin' ya, tearin' ya into two

Silly boy you self-destroyer
Paranoia, the destroyer

Self-destroyer, wreck your health
Destroy your friends, destroy yourself
The time device of self-destruction
Light the fuse and start eruption

(Yeah, it goes like this, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Here's to paranoia!)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(Hey hey, here it goes)
Paranoia, the destroyer
(and it goes like this)

Paranoia, the destroyer
(and it goes like this.)
###Tired of Waiting For You###The Kinks
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you

I was a lonely soul
I had nobody
'Til I met you
But you keep-a me waiting
All of the time
What can I do?

It's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep-a me waiting
Please don't keep-a me waiting

'Cause I'm so tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you

I was a lonely soul
I had nobody
'Til I met you
But you keep-a me waiting
All of the time
What can I do?

It's your life
And you can do what you want
Do what you like
But please don't keep-a me waiting
Please don't keep-a me waiting

'Cause I'm so tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
So tired
Tired of waiting
Tired of waiting for you
For you
For you
###Should I Stay or Should I Go###The Clash
[Verse 1]
Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here till the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day it's fine and next it's black
So if you want me off your back
Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go, there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So come on and let me know

[Verse 2]
This indecision's bugging me
Esta indecision me molesta
If you don't want me, set me free
Si no me quieres, librame
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be
Dime que tengo que ser
Don't you know which clothes even fit me?
¿Sabes que ropa me queda?
Come on and let me know
Pero me tienes que decir
Should I cool it or should I blow?
¿Me debo ir o quedarme?

Split!
Yo me enfrío o lo sufro

Should I stay or should I go now?
Yo me enfrío o lo sufro
Should I stay or should I go now?
Yo me enfrío o lo sufro
If I go there will be trouble
Si me voy va a haber peligro
And if I stay it will be double
Si me quedo sera el doble
So you gotta let me know
Pero me tienes que decir
Should I cool it or should I blow?
Yo me enfrío o lo sufro

Should I stay or should I go now?
Yo me enfrío o lo sufro
If I go there will be trouble
Si me voy va a haber peligro
And if I stay it will be double
Si me quedo sera el doble
So ya' gotta let me know
Pero me tienes que decir
Should I stay or should I go?
###Rock the Casbah###The Clash
[Verse 1]
Now the king told the boogie men
You have to let that raga drop
The oil down the desert way
Has been shaken to the top
The Sheik he drove his Cadillac
He went a' cruisin' down the ville
The muezzin was a'standing
On the radiator grill

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

[Verse 2]
By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric camel drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar pickin' thumb
As soon as the Sharif
Cleared the square
They began to wail

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

[Verse 3]
Now over at the temple
Oh! They really pack 'em in
The in crowd say it's cool
To dig this chanting thing
But as the wind changed direction
And the temple band took five
The crowd caught a whiff
Of that crazy Casbah jive

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

[Verse 4]
The king called up his jet fighters
He said "You better earn your pay
Drop your bombs between the minarets
Down the Casbah way"
As soon as the Sharif was
Chauffeured outta there
The jet pilots tuned to
The cockpit radio blare
As soon as the Sharif was
Out of their hair
The jet pilots wailed

[Chorus]
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah
Shareef don't like it
Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah

[Outro]
(Shareef don't like it)
Thinks it’s not kosher
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Fundamentally can’t take it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
You know he really hates it
(Rockin' the Casbah
Rock the Casbah)
(Shareef don't like it)
Really, really hates it
###London Calling###The Clash
London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come outta' the cupboard, ya' boys and girls
London calling, now don't look to us
Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing

The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growin' thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
Cause London is drownin', I, live by the river

(London calling) to the imitation zone
Forget it, brother, you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holdin' out and draw another breath
London calling and I don't want to shout
But while we were talking I saw you noddin' out
London calling, see we ain't got no high
'Cept for that one with the yellowy eyes

The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river

The ice age is coming, the sun's zoomin' in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growin' thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Cause London is drowning, I, I live by the river

Now get this
(London calling), yes, I was there, too
And ya' know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
(London calling) at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
(London calling)
I never felt so much alike alike alike
###Spanish Bombs###The Clash
(Verse 1)
Spanish songs in Andalucia
The shooting sites in the days of '39
Oh, please, leave the ventana open
Fredrico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of the Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flyin' in a DC 10 tonight

(Chorus)
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon

Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag
They wore the black one
After they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My senorita's rose was nipped in the bud

(Chorus)
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon


The hillsides ring with "Free the people"
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearin' music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flyin' in on a DC 10 tonight

(Chorus)
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te quiero, oh mi corazon

Spanish songs in Andalucia, Mandolina, (oh mi corazon)
Spanish songs in Granada, oh mi corazon(oh mi corazon)
(oh mi corazon)
(oh mi corazon)
###Straight to Hell###The Clash
[Verse 1]
If you can play on fiddle
How's about a British jig and reel?
Speaking King's English in quotation
As railhead towns feel the steel mills rust
Water froze in the generation
Clear as winter ice
This is your paradise

There ain't no need for ya
There ain't no need for ya
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys

[Verse 2]
Wanna join in a chorus
Of the Amerasian blues?
When it's Christmas out in Ho Chi Minh City
Kiddie say papa papa papa papa papa-san take me home
See me got photo photo
Photograph of you
And Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Of you and Mamma Mamma Mamma-san
Let me tell you 'bout your blood bamboo kid
It ain't Coca-Cola, it's rice

Straight to hell, boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys

Oh Papa-san
Please take me home
Oh Papa-san
Everybody they wanna go home
So Mamma-san says

You wanna play mind-crazed banjo
On the druggy-drag ragtime U.S.A.?
In Parkland International
Ha, Junkiedom U.S.A
Where procaine proves the purest rock man groove
And rat poison
The volatile Molotov says

Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah
Straight to hell

[Verse 3]
Can you cough it up loud and strong
The immigrants
They wanna sing all night long
It could be anywhere
Most likely could be any frontier
Any hemisphere
No man's land
There ain't no asylum here
King Solomon he never lived 'round here

Straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boy
Go straight to hell boys
Go straight to hell boys
Oh Pappa-san, please take me home
Everybody they wanna go home now
###The Guns of Brixton###The Clash
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun

When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting in death row

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, guns of Brixton

The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell

You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of The Harder They Come

You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton

(Bridge)

When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun?

You can crush us
You can bruise us
You can even shoot us
But, oh the guns of Brixton

Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game was survivin'
As in heaven, as in hell

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, guns of Brixton (x4)
###Train in Vain###The Clash
(Verse 1)
You say you stand by your man
So tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
And then you left me, said you felt trapped
Well some things you can explain away
But the heartache's in me 'til this day

(Chorus)
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

All the times when we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumblin' down
I can't be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there's only one thing I can say

(Chorus)
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way

You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all

Now I got a job, but it don't pay
I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love, I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

(Chorus)
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way


You must explain
Why this must be
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?

Did you stand by me?
No, not at all
Did you stand by me?
No way
(x2)
###Lost In the Supermarket###The Clash
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
Guaranteed personality

I wasn't born, so much as I fell out
Nobody seemed to notice me
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs
Over which, I never could see
I heard the people who live on the ceiling
Scream and fight, most scarily
Hearing that noise was my first ever feelin'
That's how it's been, all around me

(Chorus)

I'm all tuned in, I see all the programs
I save coupons from packets of tea
I've got my giant hit, discotheque album
I empty a bottle, I feel a bit free
The kids in halls and the pipes in the walls
Making noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely

(Chorus)

And it's not here
It disappeared

(Chorus x5)

I'm all lost

(Chorus)
###Clampdown###The Clash
(The kingdom is ransacked
The jewels all taken back
And the chopper descends
They're hidden in the back
With a message on a half-baked tape
And the spool goes 'round
Sayin' I'm back here in this place
And I could cry
And there's smoke you could click on)

A'what are we gonna do now?
Takin' off his turban, they said, "Is this man a Jew?"
Workin' for the clampdown
They put up a poster sayin' "We earn more than you!"
We're workin' for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers

The judge said "Five to ten" but I say "Double that again"
I'm not (workin' for the clampdown)
No man born with a livin' soul
Can be (workin' for the clampdown)
Kick over the wall, cause government's to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
D'you know that you can use it?

The voices in your head are callin'
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing comin'
Only a fool would think someone could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothin', so boy get running
It's the best years of your life they want to steal

But, you grow up and you calm down
And you're (workin' for the clampdown)
You start wearin' blue and brown
And (workin' for the clampdown)
So you got someone to boss around
It makes ya' feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
Make your first kill now

In these days of evil presidentes
(Workin' for the clampdown)
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For (workin' for the clampdown)
Ha! Get along! Get along!
(Workin' for the clampdown)
Ha! Get along! Get along!
(Workin' for the clampdown)

Yeah I’m workin' hard in Harrisburg
Workin' hard in Petersburg
(Workin' for the clampdown)
(Workin' for the clampdown)
Ha! Get along! Get along
Beggin' to be melted down
(Get along, get along)
Work
Work
And I give away no secrets – ha!
Work
More work
Work
Work
Work
Work
Work

Who's barmy now ?
###I Fought the Law###The Clash
Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won

I left my baby and it feels so bad
I guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a

Robbin' people with a six-gun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won
I lost my girl and I lost my fun
I fought the law and'a the law won
I fought the law and'a the law won

(Chorus)

I fought the law and'a the law won (x7)
I fought the law and'a
###White Man (In Hammersmith Palais)###The Clash
1,2, a'1, 2,3,4

Ooh
Midnight to six, man
For the first time from Jamaica
Dillinger and a'Leroy Smart
Delroy Wilson, your cool operator

Ken Boothe for UK pop reggae
With backin' bands sound systems
Of they got anything to say
There's many black ears here to listen

But it was Four Tops all night with encores from stage right
Charging from the bass knives to the treble
But onstage they ain't got no roots rock rebel
Onstage they ain't got no...roots rock rebel

(Dress back, jump back, this is a bluebeat attack)

'Cause it won't get you anywhere
Foolin' with the guns
The British Army is waitin' out there
An' it weighs fifteen hundred tons

White youth, black youth
Better find another solution
Why not phone up a'Robin Hood
And ask him for some wealth distribution?

Punk rocker in the UK
They won't notice anyway
They're all too busy fightin'
For a good place under the lightin'

The new groups are not concerned
With what there is to be learned
They got Burton suits, huh, ya' think it's funny
Turnin' rebellion into money

All over people changin' their votes
Along with their overcoats
If Adolf Hitler flew in today
They'd send a limousine anyway

I'm the all night drug-prowlin' wolf
Who looks so sick in the sun
I'm the white man in the Palais
Just a'lookin' for fun
Only lookin' for fun

Oh, please mister
Just leave me alone

I'm only
Lookin' for fun
###Rudie Can't Fail###The Clash
[Intro - Joe Strummer]
Sing, Michael, sing
On the route of the 19 Bus
We hear them sayin'

[Verse 1 - Mick Jones]
How you get so rude and'a reckless?
Don't you be so crude and'a feckless
You been drinkin' brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail, no, no
(We reply)
I know that my life makes you nervous
But I tell you that I can't live in service
Like the doctor whose born for a purpose
Rudie can't fail

[Chorus - Jones & Strummer]
(Ok)
I went to the market to realize (my soul)
What I need (I just don't have) (Don't have)
First they curse, then they press me 'til I hurt
Rudie can't fail

[Verse 2 - Mick Jones]
First you must cure your temper
Then find a job in a paper
You need someone for a savior
Rudie can't fail
(We reply)
Now we get a'rude and a'reckless
To been seen looking cool and speckless
An' drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail (oh no)

[Chorus]
I went to the market to realize (my soul)
'Cause what I need (I just don't have) (Don't have)
First they curse, then they press me 'til I hurt
Rudie can't fail

[Bridge - Joe Strummer]
Ok, ok
So where you wanna go today?
Hey boss man, huh, yeah
So you're looking pretty smart (Chicken skin suit) with a chicken skin suit
You think you're pretty hot (Pork pie hat) in your pork pie hat

[Outro]
Rudie can't fail (x13)
###The Magnificent Seven###The Clash
The Magnificent Seven!

Ring! Ring! It's 7:00 A.M.!
Move y'self to go again
Cold water in the face
Brings you back to this awful place
Knuckle merchants and you bankers, too
Must get up an' learn those rules
Weather man and the crazy chief
One says "Sun" and one says "Sleet"
A.M., the F.M. the P.M. too
Churnin' out that boogaloo
Gets you up and a'gets you out
But how long can you keep it up?
Gimme Honda, Gimme Sony
So cheap and real phony
Hong Kong dollar, Indian cents
English pounds and Eskimo pence

You lot! What?
Don't stop Give it all you got
You lot! What?
Don't stop
Yeah!

Workin' for a rise, better my station
Take my baby to sophistication
She's seen the ads, she thinks it's nice
Better work hard, I seen the price
Never mind that it's time for the bus
We got to work, an' you're one of us
Clocks go slow in a place of work
Minutes drag and the hours jerk

"When can I tell 'em wot I do?
In a second, maaan, a'right Chuck!"

Wave bub-bub-bub-bye to the boss
It's our profit, it's his loss
But anyway the lunch bell ring
Take one hour and do your thanng!
Cheeesboiger!

What do we have for entertainment?
Cops kickin' Gypsies on the pavement
Now the news, a'snap to attention
The lunar landing of the dentist convention
Italian mobster shoots a lobster
Seafood restaurant gets outta hand
A car in the fridge
A fridge in the car?
Like cowboys do, in TV land

You lot! What?
Don't stop, give it all you got
You lot! What?
Don't stop
(x2)

To get back to work an' sweat some more
The sun will sink an' we'll get out the door
It's no good for man to work in cages
Hits the town, he drinks his wages
You're frettin', you're sweatin'
But did you notice you ain't gettin'?
You're frettin', you're sweatin'
But did you notice not gettin' anywhere?
Don't you ever stop a'long enough to start?
To take your car outta that gear
Don't you ever stop long enough to start?
Get your car outta that gear
Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels
Came to the checkout at the 7-11
Marx was skint, but he had sense
Engels lent him the necessary pence

What have we got? Yeah
A'what have we got? Yeah-o
What have we got? Magnificence (I say)
What have we got?

Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi
Went to the park to check on the game
But they was murdered by the other team
Who went on to win 15-nil
You can't be true, you can't be false
You'll be given the same reward
Socrates and Milhous Nixon
Both went the same way, through the kitchen
Plato the Greek or Rin Tin Tin
Who's more famous to the billion millions?
News Flash: Vacuum Cleaner Sucks Up Budgie

Bye bye

The Magnificent Seven!
Magnificent!

Magnificent Seven!

Joe Strummer speaking:
This is fuckin' long, innit?
###Jimmy Jazz###The Clash

It ain't your day
Chop! Chop!
###Ghetto Defendant###The Clash
[Ginsberg]
Starved in metropolis
Hooked on necropolis
Addict of metropolis
Do the worm on the accropolis
Slamdance the cosmopolis
Enlighten the populace

[Verse 1: Strummer]
Hungry darkness of living
Who will thirst in the pit?
(Hooked in metropolis)
She spent a lifetime deciding
How to run from it
(Addicts of metropolis)
Once fate had a witness
And the years seemed like friends
(Girlfriends)
Now her child has a dream
But it begins like it ends

[Ginsberg]
Shot into eternity
Methadone kitty
Iron serenity

[Chorus]
Ghetto defendant
It is heroin pity
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city

(Strung out committee)
Walled out of the city
Clubbed down from uptown
Sprayed pest from the nest
Run out to barrio town
(The guards are itchy)
Forced to watch at the feast
Then sweep up the night
Flipped pieces of coin
(Broken bottles)
Exchanged for birthright

[Chorus]
Ghetto defendant it is heroin pity
(Strung out committee)
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city
(Not sitting pretty)
(Grafted in a jiffy)
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city

The ghetto prince of gutter poets
Was bounced out of the room
(Jean Arthur Rimbaud)
By the bodyguards of greed
For disturbing the tomb
(1873)
His words like flamethrowers
(Paris commune)
Burnt the ghettos in their chests
His face was painted whiter
And he was laid to rest
(Died in Marseille)

Ghetto defendant it is heroin pity
(Buried in Charleville)
Not tear gas nor baton charge
That stops you taking the city
(Shut up in etenity)

[Ginsberg]
Guatemala
Honduras
Poland
100 years war
TV re-run invasion
Death squad Salvador
Afghanistan
Meditation
Old Chinese flu
Kick junk
What else
Can a poor worker do?

[Chorus]
[Ginsberg chanting]
###White Riot###The Clash
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own
White riot, I wanna riot
White riot, a riot of my own

Black man got a lotta problems
But they don't mind throwin' a brick
White people go to school
Where they teach you how to be real thick

Everybody's doin'
Just what they're told to
And nobody wants
To go to jail!

(Chorus)

All the power's in the hands
Of the people rich enough to buy it
While we walk the street
Too chicken to even try it

(Bridge)

(Chorus)

Are ya' takin' over
Or are ya' takin' orders?
Are ya' goin' backwards
Or are ya' goin' forwards?

(Chorus)
###Death or Glory###The Clash
Hey

Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world
And ends up makin' payments on a sofa or a girl
"Love" and "hate" tattooed across the knuckles of his hands
Hands that slap his kids around 'cause they don't understand how

Death or glory becomes just another story
Death or glory becomes just another story

In every gimmick hungry yob diggin' gold from rock 'n' roll
Grabs the mic and tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this and it's been tested by research
He who fucks nuns will later join the church

(Chorus)

Fear in the gun sights
They say "Lie low"
You say "Ok"
Don't wanna play a show
No other thinking
Was it death or glory now?
Playin' the blues of kings
Sure looks better now

(Chorus)

In every dingy basement on every dingy street
Every draggin' handclap over every draggin' beat
That's just the beat of time, beat that must go on
If you've been tryin' for years we already heard your song

(Chorus)

Gotta march a long way
Fight a long time
Get to travel over mountains
Got to travel over seas
We gonna fight your brother
We gonna fight 'til you lose
We gonna raise trouble
We gonna raise hell
We gonna fight your brother
Raise hell

(Chorus x2)
###Wrong 'Em Boyo###The Clash
[Intro]
Stagger Lee met Billy and they got down to gambling
Stagger Lee throwed seven
Billy said that he throwed eight, hey
So Billy said, "Hey Stagger! I'm gonna make my big attack
I'm gonna have to leave my knife in your back"
(C'mon, let's start all over again)

[Verse 1]
Why do you try to cheat?
And trample people under your feet
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
To cheat the tryin' man
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
To cheat the tryin' man
But you better stop
It is the wrong 'em boyo

[Verse 2]
You lie, steal, cheat and deceit
In such a small, small game
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
To cheat the tryin' man
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
To cheat the tryin' man
You better stop
It is the wrong 'em boyo

[Verse 3]
Billy Boy has been shot
And Stagger Lee's come out on top
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
To cheat the tryin' man
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
To cheat Stagger man
You'd better stop (you better stop)
Hey, it is the wrong 'em boyo hey

[Verse 4]
So you must start all over again
All over again
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
Play it, Billy, play
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
Well play it, Billy, play
An' you will find
It is the right 'em boyo

[Verse 5]
But if you must lie and deceit
And trample people under your feet
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
To cheat the tryin' man
(Don't ya' know it is wrong?)
To cheat a tryin' man
You better stop
It is the wrong 'em boyo

[Outro]
It is the wrong 'em boyo
It is the wrong 'em boyo
It is the wrong 'em
It is the wrong 'em boyo
It is the wrong 'em boyo
###Charlie Don't Surf###The Clash
Charlie don't surf and we think he should
Charlie don't surf and you know that it ain't no good
Charlie don't surf for his hamburger Momma
Charlie's going to be a napalm star

Everybody wants to rule the world
Must be something we get from birth
One truth is we never learn
Satellites will make space burn
We've been told to keep the strangers out
We don't like them starting to hang around
We don't like them all over town
Across the world we are going to blow them down

(Chorus)

The reign of the super powers must be over
So many armies can't free the earth
Soon the rock will roll over
Africa is choking on their Coca Cola
It's a one a way street in a one horse town
One way people starting to brag around
You can laugh, put them down
These one way people going to blow us down

(Chorus)

Charlie don't surf he'll never learn
Charlie don't surf though he's got a gun
Charlie don't surf think that he should
Charlie don't surf we really think he should
Charlie don't surf
###Safe European Home###The Clash
Well, I just got back an I wish I never leave now
(Where'd ya' go?)
Who that Martian arrival at the airport, yeah?
(Where'd ya' go?)
How many local dollars for a local anesthetic?
(Where'd ya' go?)
The Johnny on the corner wasn't very sympathetic
(Where'd ya' go?)

I went to the place where every white face
Is an invitation to robbery
An' sitting here in my safe European home
Don't wanna go back there again

Wasn't I lucky, wouldn't it be lovely?
(Where'd ya' go?)
Send us all cards and have a lay in on Sunday
(Where'd ya' go?)
I was there for two weeks, so how come I never tell now?
(Where'd ya' go?)
That natty dread drinks at the Sheraton Hotel, yeah?
(Where'd ya' go?)

(Chorus)

They got the sun and they got the palm trees
(Where'd ya' go?)
They got the weed and they got the taxis
(Where'd ya' go?)
Whoa, "The Harder They Come" and the home of ol' Bluebeat
(Where'd ya' go?)
I'd stay and be a tourist but I can't take the gun play
(Where'd ya'?)

(Chorus)

What? Rudie come from Jamaica, Rudie can't fail
Rudie come from Jamaica, Rudie can't fail
Rudie come from Jamaica, 'cause Rudie can't fail
Rudie come From Jamaica, Rudie can't fail
(Our European home)

Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie can't fail
(Dull European home)
Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie can't fail
(Dutty European home)
Rudie loots and Rudie shoots and Rudie gun man don't back down
(Instant European home)
Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, guns are comin' (drum roll)
(Credits European home)
Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie can't fail
(The big lights European home)

(You got the nice guy European home)

Rudie come up from Jamaica, 'cause Rudie can't fail
And twenty-four Track European home
Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie, Rudie loots and Rudie shoots
Elder come and the Rudie go but no one knows where police must go
